Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

	doi = {10.1098/rsta.2014.0219},
	abstract = {Chemical reactions are responsible for information processing in living organisms. It is believed that the basic features of biological computing activity are reflected by a reaction-diffusion medium. We illustrate the ideas of chemical information processing considering the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and its photosensitive variant. The computational universality of information processing is demonstrated. For different methods of information coding constructions of the simplest signal processing devices are described. The function performed by a particular device is determined by the geometrical structure of oscillatory (or of excitable) and non-excitable regions of the medium. In a living organism, the brain is created as a self-grown structure of interacting nonlinear elements and reaches its functionality as the result of learning. We discuss whether such a strategy can be adopted for generation of chemical information processing devices. Recent studies have shown that lipid-covered droplets containing solution of reagents of BZ reaction can be transported by a flowing oil. Therefore, structures of droplets can be spontaneously formed at specific non-equilibrium conditions, for example forced by flows in a microfluidic reactor. We describe how to introduce information to a droplet structure, track the information flow inside it and optimize medium evolution to achieve the maximum reliability. Applications of droplet structures for classification tasks are discussed. Â© 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

The effects of a continual measurement of one angular-momentum component are introduced into the model, and its effects on quantum coherences are shown to degrade the quantum coherence effects.

This result allows one to write a factor of $N^2$ more elements on a semiconductor chip.

	abstract = {The Dirac equation is a cornerstone in the history of physics, merging successfully quantum mechanics with special relativity, providing a natural description of the electron spin and predicting the existence of anti-matter. Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

For the case of a single qubit, we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general.

	abstract = {We propose a class of qubit networks that admit perfect state transfer of any two-dimensional quantum state in a fixed period of time. We further show that such networks can distribute arbitrary entangled states between two distant parties, and can, by using such systems in parallel, transmit the higher-dimensional systems states across the network. Unlike many other schemes for quantum computation and communication, these networks do not require qubit couplings to be switched on and off. When restricted to N -qubit spin networks of identical qubit couplings, we show that 2 {log3N} is the maximal perfect communication distance for hypercube geometries. Moreover, if one allows fixed but different couplings between the qubits then perfect state transfer can be achieved over arbitrarily long distances in a linear chain. This paper expands and extends the work done by Christandl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 187902 (2004).},

its length, in a robust manner. Alternatively, they can form the basis

	abstract = {Quantum information transfer is an important part of quantum information processing. Several proposals for quantum information transfer along linear arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits or spins were made recently. Perfect transfer was shown to exist in two models with specifically designed strongly inhomogeneous couplings. We show that perfect transfer occurs in an entire class of chains, including systems whose nearest-neighbor couplings vary only weakly along the chain. The key to these observations is the {Jordan-Wigner} mapping of spins to noninteracting lattice fermions that display perfectly periodic dynamics if the single-particle energy spectrum is appropriate. After a half-period of that dynamics, any state is transformed into its mirror image with respect to the center of the chain. The absence of fermion interactions preserves these features at an arbitrary temperature and allows for the transfer of nontrivially entangled states of several spins or qubits.},

We first consider a harmonically oscillating cantilever whose vibration frequency is changed by mass accretion at its surface. We show that its zero-point fluctuations limit the mass sensitivity, for attainable parameters, to about an electron mass. In contrast to the case of a classical cantilever, we find the mass sensitivity of the quantum mechanical cantilever is independent of its resonant frequency in a certain parameter regime at low temperatures. We then consider an optomechanical setup in which the cantilever is reflective and forms one end of a laser-driven {Fabry-P{\textbackslash}'erot} cavity. For a resonator finesse of 5 the mass sensitivity at T=0 is limited by cavity noise to about a quarter of a Dalton, but this setup has a more favorable temperature dependency at finite temperature, compared to the free cantilever.},

n), where m and n run from 0 to p, are considered as the elements of a
square matrix R of order p + 1, then The reduction of the general
expression for R(m, n) to special cases of importance in molecular

	abstract = {Let M be the set of mixed states and S the set of separable states of the two-qubit system, and G = {SU(2)} x {SU(2)} the group of local unitary transformations (ignoring the overall phase factor). We compute the multigraded Poincare series for the algebra of G-invariant polynomial functions on the affine space of all Hermitian operators of trace 1. We check that this series is consistent with the list of invariants computed by Makhlin. By using the recent result of Augusiak et al., we show that the boundary of S decomposes naturally into two pieces. We prove that the part of this boundary which is contained in the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.},

	doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.81.865},
	abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalismâentanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and SchrÃ¶dingerâwaited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal formâthe bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

Moreover, in our proposal the superradiant phase transition for this model can be well controlled by the frequency of external magnetic flux when the superconducting charge qubits work at their optimal point, in which the qubits can be mostly immune from charge noise produced by uncontrollable charge fluctuations. Finally, we propose to observe this phase transition by detecting the intracavity intensity in terms of a heterodyne detector out of the cavity.},

For polaritons, charge neutrality prevents magnetic fields from providing a direct symmetry-breaking mechanism and, similar to the situation in ultracold atomic gases, an effective magnetic field has to be synthesized. We show that in the {circuit-QED} architecture, this can be achieved by inserting simple superconducting circuits into the resonator junctions. In the presence of such coupling elements, constant parallel magnetic and electric fields suffice to break time-reversal symmetry. We support these theoretical predictions with numerical simulations for realistic sample parameters, specify general conditions under which time reversal is broken, and discuss the application to chiral Fock-state transfer, an on-chip circulator, and tunable band structure for the Kagome lattice.},

Reductions in photocurrent noise greater than 60\% ({\textminus}4 dB) below the limit set by the vacuum fluctuations of the field are observed in a balanced homodyne detector. A quantitative comparison with theory suggests that the observed noise reductions result from a field that in the absence of avoidable linear attenuation would be squeezed more than tenfold. A degree of squeezing of approximately fivefold is inferred for the actual field emitted through one mirror of the optical parametric oscillator. An explicit demonstration of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the electromagnetic field is made from the measurements, which show that the field state produced by the downconversion process is a state of minimum uncertainty.},

	abstract = {As a crystal is disordered, a point may be reached where the typical mean free path of phonons is so short that the wavelength and mean free path are no longer sharp concepts, and the textbook phonon-gas model for thermal conductivity breaks down. This paper proposes an alternate theory for the disordered regime, and the subsequent paper implements the theory for a realistic model of amorphous silicon. The idea is that the dominant scattering is correctly described by a harmonic Hamiltonian, which is, in principle, transformable into a one-body problem of decoupled oscillators. >From this the thermal conductivity can be exactly calculated by an analog of the {Kubo-Greenwood} formula for electrical conductivity of disordered metals. Anderson localization is correctly contained in this theory; localized states contribute no currents in harmonic approximation. What is required is an atomistic model with a large unit cell and periodic boundary conditions (to avoid undesired surface effects). The linear size of the model should be larger than the mean free paths of the dominant phonons. A Kubo formula and then a {Kubo-Greenwood-type} formula are derived for this problem. A ââmode diffusivityââ Di for the ith exact oscillator state is defined. The heat is carried by off-diagonal elements of the heat current operator, which have a nonzero contribution because the temperature gradient introduces nonzero off-diagonal elements of the density matrix ãaiÂ°ajã. An effort is made to interpret these results physically. Schemes for implementing this formalism are discussed.},

I show that with existing carbon nanotube resonators it should be possible in principle to measure a thousandth of the mass of an electron, and future improvements might allow to reach a regime where one can measure the relativistic change of mass due to absorption of a single photon, or the creation of a chemical bond.}

However, the proof based on the general principle of complementarity of quantum mechanics applies to any scheme of phase measurement. From the general argument by the complementarity principle, we are able to find a necessary condition for those states that can achieve the Heisenberg limit if they are employed for precision phase measurement. A general guideline is given for the search of the measurement schemes in which the Heisenberg limit is achieved. We demonstrate the procedure by applying it to a few specific examples.},

So far, most of the important quantum information experiments are done with such states, including bright Gaussian light and weak Gaussian light. Extending the existing results of quantum information with discrete quantum states to the case of continuous variable quantum states is an interesting theoretical job. The quantum Gaussian states play a central role in such a case. We review the properties and applications of Gaussian states in quantum information with emphasis on the fundamental concepts, the calculation techniques and the effects of imperfections of the real-life experimental setups. Topics here include the elementary properties of Gaussian states and relevant quantum information device, entanglement-based quantum tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography with weak and strong Gaussian states and the quantum channel capacity, mathematical theory of quantum entanglement and state estimation for Gaussian states.},

Our studies are motivated by recent experiments and theoretical investigations on quantum dots and neutral atoms in microtraps as tools for quantum information processing. We present analogies between distinguishable particles, bosons, and fermions in low-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We introduce the notion of Slater rank for pure states of pairs of fermions and bosons in analogy to the Schmidt rank for pairs of distinguishable particles. This concept is generalized to mixed states and provides a correlation measure for indistinguishable particles. Then we generalize these notions to pure fermionic and bosonic states in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and also to the multi-particle case. We review the results on quantum correlations in mixed fermionic states and discuss the concept of fermionic Slater witnesses. Then the theory of quantum correlations in mixed bosonic states and of bosonic Slater witnesses is formulated. In both cases we provide methods of constructing optimal Slater witnesses that detect the degree of quantum correlations in mixed fermionic and bosonic states. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Numerous interesting questions have been addressed so far. Here an important part of this field, the properties of the entanglement in many-body systems, are reviewed. The zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion, and boson model systems are discussed. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium entanglement is shown tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test. Out of equilibrium entangled states are generated and manipulated by means of many-body Hamiltonians.},

Transition paths involving unpopulated vibrational states interfere destructively to eliminate the dependence of rates and revolution frequencies on vibrational quantum numbers. As a consequence, quantum computation becomes feasible with ions whose vibrations are strongly coupled to a thermal reservoir.},

Observation of such chaos would require a new generation of experiments on microwave superradiance, or optical variants thereof which would exploit the strong coupling characteristic of very small cavities. Similarly, collections of identical three-level atoms non-resonantly coupled to two cavity modes could provide ‘SU(3) laboratories’, capable of realizing the semiclassical and classical limits of SU(3) dynamics, both integrable and chaotic. Some of the more interesting modes of behaviour of such systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present the theory of how to achieve phase measurements with the
	minimum possible variance in ways that are readily implementable
	with current experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics
	have high-frequency fringes, such as those obtained from maximally
	path-entangled (|N,0+|0,N)/ (?NOON?) states, have commensurately
	high information yield (as quantified by the Fisher information).
	However, this information is also highly ambiguous because it does
	not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes.
	We provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly
	efficient way, providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is
	within a small constant factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum
	allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. These techniques apply
	to NOON state and multipass interferometry, as well as phase measurements
	in quantum computing. We have reported the experimental implementation
	of some of these schemes with multipass interferometry elsewhere.
	Here, we present the theoretical foundation and also present some
	additional experimental results. There are three key innovations
	to the theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase
	properties of the sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via
	the equivalent two-mode state. Second, we identify the key feature
	of the equivalent state that enables the optimal scaling of the intrinsic
	phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables us to identify appropriate
	combinations of states to use. The remaining difficulty is that the
	ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinsic phase uncertainty
	are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to solve
	this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate
	the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.
	We consider both adaptive and nonadaptive measurement schemes.},

Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise. This linear amplification noise prevents perfect copying of the quantum state, enforces quantum limits on communications and metrology, and is the mechanism preventing the increase of entanglement via local operations. Non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning and local entanglement increase (distillation) are allowed, suggesting the possibility of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for quantum states of the optical field, and use it for distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful circuit enables practical devices for enhancing quantum technologies. The idea of noiseless amplification unifies approaches to cloning and distillation, and will find applications in quantum metrology and communications.},

The measurement consists of bringing the idler field into interference with two ancilla coherent states, followed by two single-photon detectors, which, in coincidence, herald the preparation event.

Feeding a squeezed vacuum into a beam splitter and counting the photons in one of the output channels, the conditional states in the other output channel exhibit a number of properties that are very similar to those of superpositions of two coherent states with opposite phases. We present analytical and numerical results for the photon-number and quadrature-component distributions of the conditional states and their Wigner and Husimi functions. Further, we discuss the effect of realistic photocounting on the states.},

Heralded photon addition or subtraction is, as a matter of fact, at the heart of continuous-variable entanglement distillation. The use of such processes has recently been experimentally demonstrated in the context of the generation of optical coherent-state superpositions or the verification of canonical commutation relations. Here, we carry out a systematic study of the effect of local photon additions and subtractions on a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, showing that the entanglement generally increases with the number of such operations. This is analytically proven when additions or subtractions are restricted to one mode only, while we observe that the highest entanglement is achieved when these operations are equally shared between the two modes. We also note that adding photons typically provides a stronger entanglement enhancement than subtracting photons, while photon subtraction performs better in terms of energy efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between entanglement and non-Gaussianity, showing that it is more subtle than previously expected.},

We here investigate how a quantum-noise-limited amplifier can be improved by additionally employing the photon subtraction, the photon addition, and a coherent superposition of the two, thereby making a probabilistic, heralded, quantum amplifier. We show that these operations can enhance the performance in amplifying a coherent state in terms of intensity gain, fidelity, and phase uncertainty. In particular, the photon subtraction turns out to be optimal for the fidelity and the phase concentration among these elementary operations, while the photon addition also provides a significant reduction in the phase uncertainty with the largest gain effect.},

We analyze different strategies of local photon subtraction from a two-mode squeezed state in terms of entanglement gain and success probability. We develop a general framework that incorporates imperfections and losses in all stages of the process: before, during, and after subtraction. By combining all three effects into a single efficiency parameter, we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction strategies using photon-number-resolving and threshold detectors. We compare the entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction scenarios across the two modes. For a given amount of loss, we identify an optimized set of parameters, such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam splitter transmissivity, that maximize the entanglement gain rate. We identify regimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different Fock states on the two modes outperforms symmetric strategies. In the lossless limit, subtracting a single photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate. In the lossy case, the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each mode individually, such that there is no general optimal strategy. Rather, taking losses on each mode as the only input parameters, we can identify the optimal subtraction strategy and required beam splitter transmissivities and initial squeezing parameter. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the distillation of continuous-variable quantum entanglement.},

	title = {Positive Wigner Functions Render Classical Simulation of Quantum Computation Efficient},
	volume = {109},
	abstract = {We show that quantum circuits where the initial state and all the following quantum operations can be represented by positive Wigner functions can be classically efficiently simulated. This is true both for continuous-variable as well as discrete variable systems in odd prime dimensions, two cases which will be treated on entirely the same footing. Noting the fact that Clifford and Gaussian operations preserve the positivity of the Wigner function, our result generalizes the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Our algorithm provides a way of sampling from the output distribution of a computation or a simulation, including the efficient sampling from an approximate output distribution in the case of sampling imperfections for initial states, gates, or measurements. In this sense, this work highlights the role of the positive Wigner function as separating classically efficiently simulable systems from those that are potentially universal for quantum computing and simulation, and it emphasizes the role of negativity of the Wigner function as a computational resource.},

By expressing the quantum Fisher information ({QFI)} and the elusive symmetric logarithmic derivative ({SLD)} in terms of the state's moments (and their derivatives) we are able to obtain the noncommutative extension of the well known expression for the Fisher information of a Gaussian probability distribution. Focusing on models with fixed first moments and identical Williamson 'diagonal' states --which include pure state models--, we obtain their {SLD} and {QFI}, and elucidate what features of the Wigner function are fundamentally accessible, and at what rates. In addition, we find the optimal homodyne detection scheme for all such models, and show that for pure state models they attain the fundamental limit.},

	abstract = {The time evolution of quantum correlations of entangled two-mode continuous variable states is examined in single-reservoir as well as two-reservoir models, representing noisy correlated or uncorrelated non-Markovian quantum channels. For this purpose the model of quantum Brownian motion is extended. Various separability criteria for Gaussian continuous variable systems are applied. In both types of reservoir models moderate non-Markovian effects prolong the separability time scales. However, in these models the properties of the stationary state may differ. In the two-reservoir model the initial entanglement is completely lost and both modes are finally uncorrelated. In a common reservoir both modes interact indirectly via the coupling to the same bath variables. Below a critical bath temperature entanglement between the two modes is preserved even in the steady state. A separability criterion is derived, which depends on the bath temperature and the response function of the open quantum system. Thus, the extended quantum Brownian motion model of a two-mode continuous variable system in a common reservoir provides an example of environment-induced entanglement.},

Another phase (sudden death and revival) is characterized by an infinite sequence of events of sudden death and revival of entanglement. In the third phase (no sudden death) there is no sudden death of entanglement, which persists for a long time. The phase diagram is described and analytic expressions for the boundary between phases are obtained. These results are applicable to a large variety of non-Markovian environments.

	abstract = {Multi-mode entanglement is investigated in a system composed of N coupled identical harmonic oscillators interacting with a common environment. We treat the problem generally by working with the Hamiltonian without the rotating-wave approximation and by considering the environment as a non-Markovian reservoir to the oscillators. We invoke an N-mode unitary transformation of the position and momentum operators and find that in the transformed basis the system is represented by a set of independent harmonic oscillators with only one of them coupled to the environment. Working in the Wigner representation of the density operator, we find that the covariance matrix has a block diagonal form that can be expressed in terms of multiples of 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 matrices. This simple property allows us to treat the problem to some extent analytically. We illustrate the advantage of working in the transformed basis using a simple example of three harmonic oscillators and find that the entanglement can persist for long times due to the presence of constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements. We find that, in contrast to what one would expect, a strong damping of the oscillators leads to a better stationary entanglement than in the case of a weak damping.},

He was the first American to learn of the discovery of nuclear fission, later coined the term "black hole," led a renaissance in gravitation physics, and helped to build Princeton University into a mecca for physicists. From nuclear physics, to quantum theory, to relativity and gravitation, Wheeler's work has set the trajectory of research for half a century. His career has brought him into contact with the most brilliant minds of his field; Fermi, Bethe, Rabi, Teller, Oppenheimer, and Wigner are among those he called colleagues and friends. In this rich autobiography, Wheeler reveals in fascinating detail the excitement of each discovery, the character of each colleague, and the underlying passion for knowledge that drives him still.

This foam can be thought of as being built out of three basic kinds of units or âgravitational bubblesâ, {CP}2, S2 Ã S2 and K3. We investigate the propagation of particles in simple models of the first two types of bubble. The non-trivial topologies of the bubbles introduce extra singularities into the Green functions. These make large contributions to the S-matrix for scalar particles but only small contributions for spin-12 or 1 particles at energies small compared to the Planck length. These results suggest that there is no inconsistency between the spacetime foam picture and everyday observations from which spacetime appears nearly flat, because all the elementary particles we have observed have spin 12 or greater. They do, however, suggest that Higgs scalar fields, if they exist at all, are probably bound states of higher spin particles rather than being elementary fields. Further developments may enable one to calculate processes in which quantum coherence is lost and intrinsic entropy is produced.},

The properties of this fuzziness and the length scale that characterizes itsonset are potentially a means for determining which (if any) of the existing models of quantum gravity is correct. But it is generally believed5 that these quantum space-time effects are too small to be probed by technologies currently available. Here Iargue that modern gravity-wave interferometers are sensitive enough to test certain space-time fuzziness models, because quantum space-time effects should provide an additional source of noise in the interferometers that can be tightly constrained experimentally. The noise levels recently achieved in one interferometer6 are sufficient to rule out values of the length scale that characterizes one of the space-time fuzziness models down to the Planck length (10-35 m) and beyond, while the sensitivity required to test another model should be achievable with interferometers now under construction.},

In this paper we generalize recently introduced techniques to estimate physical quantities within quantum field theory in flat and curved space-time. We consider a bosonic quantum field that undergoes a generic transformation, which encodes the parameter to be estimated. We present analytical formulas for optimal precision bounds on the estimation of small parameters in terms of Bogoliubov coefficients for single-mode and two-mode Gaussian channels.},

Four key examples are given, describing quantum limited estimation for: acceleration, black holes, gravitational waves and cosmology.

Quantum metrology has been so far successfully applied to design precision instruments such as clocks and sensors which outperform classical devices by exploiting quantum properties. There are advanced plans to implement these and other quantum technologies in space, for instance Space-{QUEST} and Space Optical Clock projects intend to implement quantum communications and quantum clocks at regimes where relativity starts to kick in. However, typical setups do not take into account the effects of relativity on quantum properties. To include and exploit these effects, we introduce techniques for the application of metrology to quantum field theory. Quantum field theory properly incorporates quantum theory and relativity, in particular, at regimes where space-based experiments take place. This framework allows for high precision estimation of parameters that appear in quantum field theory including proper times and accelerations. Indeed, the techniques can be applied to develop a novel generation of relativistic quantum technologies for gravimeters, clocks and sensors. As an example, we present a high precision device which in principle improves the state-of-the-art in quantum accelerometers by exploiting relativistic effects.},

This map projection, based on the logarithm map of the complex plane, preserves shapes locally and yet is able to display the entire range of astronomical scales from the Earth's neighborhood to the cosmic microwave background. The conformal nature of the projection, preserving shapes locally, may be of particular use for analyzing large-scale structure. Prominent in the map is a Sloan Great Wall of galaxies 1.37 billion light-years long, 80\% longer than the Great Wall discovered by Geller and Huchra and therefore the largest observed structure in the universe.},

We construct an explicit realization by treating photon propagation through quantum excitations of D-brane fluctuations in the space-time foam. These are described by higher-genus string effects, that lead to stochastic fluctuations in couplings, and hence in the velocity of light. We discuss the possibilities of constraining or measuring photon diffusion in vacuo via Î³-ray observations of distant astrophysical sources.},

These metric fluctuations will introduce fluctuations of the light cone. It is shown that when the various two-point functions of a quantized field are averaged over the metric fluctuations, the light cone singularity disappears for distinct points. The metric-averaged functions remain singular in the limit of coincident points. The metric-averaged retarded Greenâs function for a massless field becomes a Gaussian which is nonzero both inside and outside of the classical light cone. This implies some photons propagate faster than the classical light speed, whereas others propagate slower. The possible effects of metric fluctuations upon one-loop quantum processes are discussed and illustrated by the calculation of the one-loop electron self-energy.},

However, a pair of photons emitted in rapid succession will tend to have correlated flight times. We derive and discuss a correlation function which describes this effect.

	abstract = {In The Quantum Theory of Fields, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg combines his exceptional physical insight with his gift for clear exposition to provide a self-contained, comprehensive, and up-to-date introduction to quantum field theory.         This is a two-volume work.  Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before, and emphasizing the reasons why such a theory should describe nature.  After a brief historical outline, the book begins anew with the principles about which we are most certain, relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow from these principles.  Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence.   The author presents the classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. His account of renormalization theory reflects the changes in our view of quantum field theory since the advent of effective field theories.    The book's scope extends beyond quantum electrodynamics to elementary particle physics, and nuclear physics.  It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Problems are included at the end of each chapter.   This work will be an invaluable reference for all physicists and mathematicians who use quantum field theory, and it is also appropriate as a textbook for graduate students in this area.},

	abstract = {The post-Newtonian theory of motion of celestial bodies and propagation of light was instrumental in conducting the critical experimental tests of general relativity and in building the astronomical ephemerides of celestial bodies in the Solar System with unparalleled precision. The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the Solar System is gravitationally isolated from the rest of the Universe and the background spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present article extends this theoretical concept and formulates the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and light moving in the gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded to the expanding Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker universe. We formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einsteinâs field equations in the conformally flat Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime and analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles and light in this limit. We prove that by doing conformal spacetime transformations, one can reduce the equations of motion of particles and light to the classical form of the Newtonian theory. However, the time arguments in the equations of motion of particles and light differ from each other in terms being proportional to the Hubble constant H. This leads to the important conclusion that the equations of light propagation used currently by space navigation centers for fitting range and Doppler-tracking observations of celestial bodies are missing some terms of the cosmological origin that are proportional to the Hubble constant H. We also analyze the effect of the cosmological expansion on motion of electrons in atoms. We prove that the Hubble expansion does not affect the atomic frequencies and hence does not affect the atomic time scale used in the creation of astronomical ephemerides. We derive the cosmological correction to the light travel time equation and argue that its measurement opens an exciting opportunity to determine the local value of the Hubble constant H in the Solar System independently of cosmological observations.},

A model of Quantum Spacetime is then discussed where the commutation relations exactly implement our uncertainty relations. We outline the definition of free fields and interactions over {QST} and take the first steps to adapting the usual perturbation theory. The quantum nature of the underlying spacetime replaces a local interaction by a specific nonlocal effective interaction in the ordinary Minkowski space. A detailed study of interacting {QFT} and of the smoothing of ultraviolet divergences is deferred to a subsequent paper. In the classical limit where the Planck length goes to zero, our Quantum Spacetime reduces to the ordinary Minkowski space times a two component space whose components are homeomorphic to the tangent {bundleTS} 2 of the 2-sphere. The relations with Conne's theory of the standard model will be studied elsewhere.},

	abstract = {We study the cosmological evolution of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave in a resonant optical cavity placed to the expanding manifold described by the RobertsonâWalker metric. Because of the Einstein principle of equivalence ({EEP}), one can find a local coordinate system (a local freely falling frame), in which spacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the RobertsonâWalker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial coordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local time coordinate, X0X{\textasciicircum}0 . Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a straightforward implementation of {EEP} alone does not allow us to unambiguously decide whether atomic clocks based on quantum transitions of atoms, ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of a cavity. To resolve this ambiguity we have to analyse the cavity rigidity and the oscillation of its electromagnetic modes in an expanding universe by employing the full machinery of the Maxwell equations irrespectively of the underlying theory of gravity. We proceed in this way and found out that the size of the cavity and the electromagnetic frequency experience an adiabatic drift in conformal (unphysical) coordinates as the universe expands in accordance with the Hubble law. We set up the oscillation equation for the resonant electromagnetic modes, solve it by the {WKB} approximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their counterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock. The solution shows that there is a perfect mutual cancellation of the adiabatic drift of cavityâs frequency by space transformation to local coordinates and the time counted by the clocks based on electromagnetic modes of cavity has the same rate as that of atomic clocks. We conclude that if general relativity is correct and the local expansion of space is isotropic there should be no cosmological drift of frequency of a standing electromagnetic wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared to the frequency of atomic clocks. Continuous comparison of the frequency of the optical cavity resonator against that of atomic clock yields a powerful null test of the local isotropy of the Hubble expansion and the Einstein equivalence principle in cosmology.},

We show that Bose-Einstein condensation can lead to sub-shot-noise sensitivity for the measurement of the chemical potential. We also examine the influence of interactions on the sensitivity in three different models and show that mean-field and contact interactions deteriorate the sensitivity but only slightly for experimentally accessible weak interactions.},

	abstract = {We develop a formulation of quantum damping theory in which the explicit nature of inputs from a heat bath, and of outputs into it, is taken into account. Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of ââquantum white noiseââ is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDEâs) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDEâs: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDEâs developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

Each quantum jump of the atomic electron projects the atomic wave function to the ground state of the atom.

An extension of the theory to include mechanical light effects and a generalization to atomic systems with Zeeman substructure are given.

	abstract = {A fully quantum-mechanical treatment of resonant light scattering is presented. The incident field is assumed to be described by a coherent state, and is allowed to be intense enough to cause saturation. Complete solutions are obtained for the correlated atom-field pure state vector, including multiphoton contributions of arbitrary order. The frequency spectrum of the scattered field is evaluated and is found to agree exactly with the result previously obtained by means of the quantum fluctuation-regression theorem. A derivation of the fluctuation-regression theorem and of the optical Bloch equations is given which is fully quantum mechanical and which relies upon no assumption of statistical factorization of atom and field states. The accuracy of the result found for the scattered - field spectrum is thus shown to be limited only by the assumption of the smallness of the saturated linewidth compared to the (optical) atomic resonance frequency. The one-photon approximation is analyzed in some detail. The method of adding an imaginary term to the upper-atomic-state energy is clarified, and it is shown how the vacuum and one-photon amplitudes thereby obtained may be used, within a simple and plausible iteration scheme, to construct the complete multiphoton spectrum. A variety of commonly used injection schemes and methods of representing atomic relaxation are discussed, and comparisons are made with results found by other authors. The entire analysis is performed with the aid of a canonical transformation which replaces the applied field by a c number. It is thus proved quite rigorously and generally that the use of a c-number applied field is a fully quantum-mechanical procedure, provided only that radiation-reaction terms are retained.},

	abstract = {Non-equilibrium quantum dynamics represents an emerging paradigm for condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and statistical mechanics. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms offer an attractive platform to study driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum spin models with long-range order. Here, we explore the conditions under which stationary many-body entanglement persists with near-unit fidelity and high scalability. In our approach, coherent many-body dynamics is driven by Rydberg-mediated laser transitions, while atoms at the lattice boundary reduce the entropy of the many-body state. Surprisingly, the many-body entanglement is established by continuously evolving a locally dissipative Rydberg system towards the steady-state, as with optical pumping. We characterize the dynamics of multipartite entanglement in a 1D lattice by way of quantum uncertainty relations, and demonstrate the long-range behavior of the stationary entanglement with finite-size scaling, reaching "hectapartite" entanglement under experimental conditions. Our work opens a route towards dissipative preparation of many-body entanglement with unprecedented scaling behavior.},

to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of noisy measurements
by measuring identically prepared systems N
times and averaging the measurement results. This leads
to a scaling of the sensitivity as 1/âN, known in quantum
measurement theory as the âstandard quantum limitâ
(SQL). It is known that if one puts the N systems into an
entangled state, a scaling as 1/N can be achieved, the socalled
âHeisenberg limitâ (HL), but decoherence problems
have so far prevented implementation of such protocols
for large N. Here we show that a method of coherent averaging
inspired by a recent entanglement-free quantum
enhanced measurement protocol is capable of achieving a
sensitivity that scales as 1/N in a purely classical setup.
This may substantially improve the measurement of very
weak interactions in the classical realm, and, in particular,
open a novel route to measuring the gravitational constant
with enhanced precision.},

	abstract = {The use of the Van Cittert--Zernike theorem for the formulation of the visibility function in satellite-based Earth observation with passive radiometers does not take into account the relative motion of the observer (the satellite antenna) with respect to sources of the electro-magnetic fields at the surface of the Earth. The motion of the observer leads on the one hand to a more complex signal due to a pixel-dependent Doppler shift that is neglected in the standard derivation of the Van Cittert--Zernike theorem, but on the other hand one may hope that it could be employed for a temporal aperture synthesis, where virtual baselines are created through the motion of the satellite. Here, we generalize the formulation of the aperture synthesis concept to the case of observers moving with respect to the sources, and to the correlation of fields measured at times that differ by the travel time of the observer along a virtual baseline. Our derivation is based on first principles, starting with the wave propagation in the Earth reference frame of electro-magnetic fields arising from incoherent current sources, and Lorentz transforming the fields into the reference frame of the satellite. Our detailed study leads to the remarkable conclusion that the delay time due to observer motion cancels exactly the Doppler effect. This justifies the neglect of the Doppler effect in existing imaging systems based on the standard Van Cittert--Zernike theorem.},

However, the angular resolution can be improved by means of aperture synthesis interferometric techniques. A narrow beam is synthesized during the image formation processing of the cross-correlations measured at zero-lag between pairs of signals collected by an array of antennas. The angular resolution is then determined by the maximum antenna spacing normalized to the wavelength (baseline). The next step in improving the angular resolution is the Doppler-Radiometer, somehow related to the super-synthesis radiometers and the Radiometer-SAR. This paper presents the concept of a three-antenna Doppler-Radiometer for 2D imaging. The performance of this instrument is evaluated in terms of angular/spatial resolution and radiometric sensitivity, and an L-band illustrative example is presented},

Being a peculiar form of entanglement, bound entanglement emerges in certain mixed quantum states. This form of entanglement is not distillable by local operators and classical communication. Bound-entangled states are different from both the free entangled (distillable) and separable states. Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of a four-qubit polarization bound-entangled state, the so-called Smolin state. We have fully characterized its entanglement properties. Moreover, we have realized unlocking of the entanglement protocol for this state. The special properties of the Smolin state constitute a useful quantum resource for new multiparty communication schemes.},

	abstract = {We find an operational interpretation for the 4-tangle as a type of residual entanglement, somewhat similar to the interpretation of the 3-tangle. Using this remarkable interpretation, we are able to find the class of maximally entangled four-qubits states which is characterized by four real parameters. The states in the class are maximally entangled in the sense that their average bipartite entanglement with respect to all possible bipartite cuts is maximal. We show that while all the states in the class maximize the average tangle, there are only a few states in the class that maximize the average Tsillas or Renyi ÃÂ±-entropy of entanglement. Quite remarkably, we find that up to local unitaries, there exists two unique states, one maximizing the average ÃÂ±-Tsallis entropy of entanglement for all ÃÂ± Ã¢Â©Â¾ 2, while the other maximizing it for all 0 \&lt; ÃÂ± Ã¢Â©Â½ 2 (including the von-Neumann case of ÃÂ± = 1). Furthermore, among the maximally entangled four qubits states, there are only three maximally entangled states that have the property that for two, out of the three bipartite cuts consisting of two-qubits verses two-qubits, the entanglement is 2 ebits and for the remaining bipartite cut the entanglement between the two groups of two qubits is 1 ebit. The unique three maximally entangled states are the three cluster states that are related by a swap operator. We also show that the cluster states are the only states (up to local unitaries) that maximize the average ÃÂ±-Renyi entropy of entanglement for all ÃÂ± Ã¢Â©Â¾ 2.},

	abstract = {From both theoretical and experimental points of view symmetric states constitute an important class of multipartite states. Still, entanglement properties of these states, in particular those with positive partial transposition (PPT), lack a systematic study. Aiming at filling in this gap, we have recently affirmatively answered the open question of existence of four-qubit entangled symmetric states with PPT and thoroughly characterized entanglement properties of such states [J. Tura et al., Phys. Rev. A 85, 060302(R) (2012)]. With the present contribution we continue on characterizing PPT entangled symmetric states. On the one hand, we present all the results of our previous work in a detailed way. On the other hand, we generalize them to systems consisting of an arbitrary number of qubits. In particular, we provide criteria for separability of such states formulated in terms of their ranks. Interestingly, for most of the cases, the symmetric states are either separable or typically separable. Then, edge states in these systems are studied, showing in particular that to characterize generic PPT entangled states with four and five qubits, it is enough to study only those that assume few (respectively, two and three) specific configurations of ranks. Finally, we numerically search for extremal PPT entangled states in such systems consisting of up to 23 qubits. One can clearly notice regularity behind the ranks of such extremal states, and, in particular, for systems composed of odd numbers of qubits we find a single configuration of ranks for which there are extremal states.},

The entanglement of formation of a mixed state Ï is the minimum average entanglement of an ensemble of pure states that represents Ï. An earlier paper conjectured an explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of a pair of binary quantum objects (qubits) as a function of their density matrix, and proved the formula for special states. The present paper extends the proof to arbitrary states of this system and shows how to construct entanglement-minimizing decompositions.},

It determines the metric of flat space-time, presents an upper bound to the speed of all matter and information with respect to any inertial reference frame in the Universe, and plays a crucial role for applications such as satellite-based navigation systems. Its value is fixed by convention to the value \$c=299 792 458\$ m/s. However, advanced theories predict possible deviations from this universal value, or even quantum fluctuations of \$c\$. Combining arguments from quantum parameter estimation theory and general relativity, we here establish rigorously the existence of lower bounds on the precision to which the speed of light can be determined \$in\$ \$principle\$.},

We use quantum Fisher information as a measure of the accuracy of estimation to compare protocols which use collections of qubits in product states to one in which the qubits are in a correlated state. We show that, for certain parameter values and initial states, the correlated state protocol can yield a greater accuracy per channel invocation than the product state protocols. We show that, for some parameters and initial states, using more than two qubits and channel invocations is advantageous. These results stand in contrast to the known optimal case that uses pure initial states and a single channel invocation on a pair of entangled qubits.},

This comparison includes cases where the ancilla is itself depolarizing and where the probe is circulated back through the channel before measurement. Compared on the basis of (quantum Fisher) information gained per channel use, we find broadly that entanglement with an ancilla dominates the other two schemes, but only if entanglement is cheap relative to the cost per channel use and only if the external ancilla is well shielded from depolarization. We arrive at these results by a relatively simple analytical means. A separate, more complicated analysis for partially entangled probes shows for the qudit depolarizing channel that any amount of probe entanglement is advantageous and that the greatest advantage comes with maximal entanglement.},

The channel directions are defined as the contracting directions of the channel with an arbitrary fixed basis of Pauli- matrices. In the qubit Pauli channel case with known channel directions it is shown that the optimal configuration that maximizes the Fisher information of the estimated parameters consists of three von Neumann measurements together with pure input states directed to the appropriate channel directions. Extensions of these results for generalized Pauli channels are also given. Furthermore, a computationally efficient estimation method is proposed for estimating the channel directions in the qubit Pauli channel case. The efficiency of this method is illustrated by simulations: it is shown that its variance is of order 1/N, where N is the number of used measurements.},

This quantum-classical transition is uniquely determined by the number of photons being lost, instead of the number of incident photons or the photon loss rate alone.

Through a generic approach of construction of suitable Hermitian operators we prove the completeness of the separation axiom for identifying any separable state that is not absolutely separable. We demonstrate the action of such witness operators in different qudit systems. Examples of mixed separable systems are provided, pointing out the utility of the witness in entanglement creation using quantum gates. Decomposition of witnesses in terms of spin operators or photon polarizations facilitates their measurability for qubit states.},

We investigate whether or not it is the case that \${\textbackslash}rho\$ is absolutely separable if and only if \$U{\textbackslash}rho U{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger\$ has positive partial transpose for all unitary matrices \$U\$. In particular, we develop an easy-to-use method for showing that an entanglement witness or positive map is unable to detect entanglement in any such state, and we apply our method to many well-known separability criteria, including the range criterion, the realignment criterion, the Choi map and its generalizations, and the Breuer-Hall map.

First we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with spin squeezed states, with Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger states, Dicke states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum Fisher information and the Cram{\'e}r--Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological tasks.

This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements.

It can be used as a measure of the quantumness of correlations. Separability of the density matrix describing a pair of systems does not guarantee vanishing of the discord, thus showing that absence of entanglement does not imply classicality. We relate this to the quantum superposition principle, and consider the vanishing of discord as a criterion for the preferred effectively classical states of a system, i.e., the pointer states.},

	Abstract = {One of the best signatures of nonclassicality in a quantum system is the existence of correlations that have no classical counterpart. Different methods for quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are among the more actively studied topics of quantum-information theory over the past decade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many cases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing quantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between the quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states. Here different notions of classical and quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord and other related measures are reviewed. In the first half, the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations are reviewed, related to each other, and the classical-quantum division that is common among them is discussed. In the second half, it is shown that the measures identify and quantify the deviation from classicality in various quantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system dynamics, and many-body physics. It is shown that in many cases quantum correlations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.},

	Abstract = {A quantum illumination protocol exploits correlated light beams to enhance the probability of detection of a partially reflecting object lying in a very noisy background. Recently a simple photon-number-detection-based implementation of a quantum illumination-like scheme was provided in Phys. Rev. Lett.101, 153603 (2013), where the enhancement was preserved despite the loss of nonclassicality. In the present paper, we investigate the source for quantum advantage in that realization. We introduce an effective two-mode description of the light sources and analyze the mutual information (MI) as a quantifier of total correlations in the effective two-mode picture. In the relevant regime of a highly thermalized background, we find that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by the entangled sources over the unentangled thermal ones amounts exactly to the ratio of the effective MIs of the corresponding sources. More precisely, both quantities tend to a common limit specified by the squared ratio of the respective cross correlations. A thorough analysis of the experimental data confirms this theoretical result.},

@article{Roga2015,
	Abstract = {In quantum reading, a quantum state of light (transmitter) is applied to read classical information. In the presence of noise or for sufficiently weak signals, quantum reading can outperform classical reading by reason of enhanced state distinguishability. Here we show that enhanced quantum efficiency depends on the presence in the transmitter of a particular type of quantum correlations, the discord of response. Different encodings and transmitters give rise to different levels of efficiency. Considering noisy quantum probes, we show that squeezed thermal transmitters with non-symmetrically distributed noise among the field modes yield higher quantum efficiency compared with coherent thermal quantum states. The noise-enhanced quantum advantage is a consequence of the discord of response being a non-decreasing function of increasing thermal noise under constant squeezing, a behavior that leads to increased state distinguishability. We finally show that, for non-symmetric squeezed thermal states, the probability of error, as measured by the quantum Chernoff bound, vanishes asymptotically with increasing local thermal noise with finite global squeezing. Therefore, with fixed finite squeezing, noisy but strongly discordant quantum states with a large noise imbalance between the field modes can outperform noisy classical resources as well as pure entangled transmitters with the same finite level of squeezing.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose–Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.},

	abstract = {We propose an entanglement-creation scheme in a multi-atom ensemble trapped in an optical cavity, named entanglement amplification, converting unentangled states into entangled states and amplifying less-entangled ones to maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states whose fidelity is logarithmically dependent on the atom number and robust against common experimental noises. The scheme starts with a multi-atom ensemble initialized in a coherent spin state. By shifting the energy of a particular Dicke state, we break the Hilbert space of the ensemble into two isolated subspaces to tear the coherent spin state into two components so that entanglement is introduced. After that, we utilize the isolated subspaces to further enhance the entanglement by coherently separating the two components. By single-particle Rabi drivings on atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity illuminated by a single-frequency light, 2000-atom GHZ states can be created with a fidelity above 80\% in an experimentally achievable system, making resources of ensembles at Heisenberg limit practically available for quantum metrology.},

	Abstract = {The detection of weak magnetic fields with high spatial resolution is an important problem in diverse areas ranging from fundamental physics and material science to data storage and biomedical science. Here, we explore a novel approach to the detection of weak magnetic fields that takes advantage of recently developed techniques for the coherent control of solid-state electron spin quantum bits. Specifically, we investigate a magnetic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond. We discuss two important applications of this technique: a nanoscale magnetometer that could potentially detect precession of single nuclear spins and an optical magnetic-field imager combining spatial resolution ranging from micrometres to millimetres with a sensitivity approaching a few fT Hzâ1/2.},

The approach provides a clear insight into the interplay between decoherence and the extent of the prior knowledge in determining the optimal interrogation times and optimal estimation strategies. We propose a general framework capable of describing the local oscillator noise as well as additional atomic dephasing effects. We also demonstrate an important fact: the average Bayesian cost can be expressed explicitly using the quantum Fisher information and thus establish a direct link between the two, often competing, approaches to quantum estimation theory.},

	Abstract = {The Heisenberg limit traditionally provides a lower bound on the phase uncertainty scaling as 1/{\textless}N{\textgreater}, where {\textless}N{\textgreater} is the mean number of photons in the probe. However, this limit has a number of loopholes which potentially might be exploited, to achieve measurements with even greater accuracy. Here we close these loopholes by proving a completely rigorous form of the Heisenberg limit for the average error over all phase shifts. Our result gives the first completely general, constraint-free and non-asymptotic statement of the Heisenberg limit. It holds for all phase estimation schemes, including multiple passes, nonlinear phase shifts, multimode probes, and arbitrary measurements.},

	Abstract = {Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing, measurement, and communication. This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well developed techniques for trapping, controlling and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can couple strongly to external forces and light fields, which makes them ideal for ultra-precise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating non-classical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate successful theoretical proposals and experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.},

This scheme relies on a two-mode squeezed state, linear mixing, and a n-photon detection. It is optimally using expensive non-Gaussian resources to build up only the key non-Gaussian part of the targeted state. In the experimental case of a two-photon detection based on high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, the freely propagating state exhibits a 67\% fidelity with a squeezed even coherent-state superposition with a size {\textbar}Î±{\textbar}2=3. The demonstrated procedure and the achieved rate will facilitate the use of such superpositions in subsequent protocols, including fundamental tests and optical hybrid quantum information implementations.},

@article{vlastakis_deterministically_2013,
	Abstract = {Coherently Controlling Large Cats
The control and manipulation of quantum information based on superconducting circuits is an attractive route because of the possibility of scale-up. Vlastakis et al. (p. 607, published online 26 September; see the Perspective by Leek) were able to generate and control quantum entanglement between a superconducting qubit and hundreds of photons stored in a cavity resonator by using deterministic methods for on-demand generation of large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states in a microwave cavity with arbitrary size and phase. The ability to map the state of a qubit to large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states should provide a robust quantum resource in future quantum-based technologies.
In contrast to a single quantum bit, an oscillator can store multiple excitations and coherences provided one has the ability to generate and manipulate complex multiphoton states. We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons. With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states, known as a ``cat state.'' We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.

	Abstract = {Quantum error-correcting codes are constructed that embed a finite-dimensional code space in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a system described by continuous quantum variables. These codes exploit the noncommutative geometry of phase space to protect against errors that shift the values of the canonical variables q and p. In the setting of quantum optics, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation can be executed on the protected code subspace using linear optical operations, squeezing, homodyne detection, and photon counting; however, nonlinear mode coupling is required for the preparation of the encoded states. Finite-dimensional versions of these codes can be constructed that protect encoded quantum information against shifts in the amplitude or phase of a d-state system. Continuous-variable codes can be invoked to establish lower bounds on the quantum capacity of Gaussian quantum channels.},

@article{deleglise_reconstruction_2008,
	Abstract = {The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum--classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schr{\"o}dinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schr{\"o}dinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schr{\"o}dinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities.},

	Abstract = {Microwave photons trapped in a superconducting cavity constitute an ideal system to realize some of the thought experiments imagined by the founding fathers of quantum physics. The interaction of these trapped photons with Rydberg atoms crossing the cavity illustrates fundamental aspects of measurement theory. The experiments performed with this ``photon box'' at Ecole Normale Sup{\'e}rieure (ENS) belong to the domain of quantum optics called ``cavity quantum electrodynamics.'' We have realized the nondestructive counting of photons, the recording of field quantum jumps, the preparation and reconstruction of ``Schr{\"o}dinger cat'' states of radiation and the study of their decoherence, which provides a striking illustration of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. These experiments have also led to the demonstration of basic steps in quantum information processing, including the deterministic entanglement of atoms and the realization of quantum gates using atoms and photons as quantum bits. This lecture starts by an introduction stressing the connection between the ENS photon box and the ion-trap experiments of David Wineland, whose accompanying lecture recalls his own contribution to the field of single particle control. I give then a personal account of the early days of cavity quantum electrodynamics before describing the main experiments performed at ENS during the last 20 years and concluding by a discussion comparing our work to other researches dealing with the control of single quantum particles.},

@article{yonezawa_quantum-enhanced_2012,
	Abstract = {Keeping Track of Photon Phase
In optical interferometers or optical communications, information is often stored in terms of the phase of the waveform or light pulse. However, fluctuations and noise can give rise to random jitter in the phase and amplitude of the optical pulses, making it difficult to keep track of the phase. Yonezawa et al. (p. 1514) developed a technique based on quantum mechanical squeezing to determine the phase of randomly varying optical waveforms. The quantum mechanical technique enhanced the precision with which the phase could be determined and, as optical technologies continue to be miniaturized, should be helpful in applications within metrology.
Tracking a randomly varying optical phase is a key task in metrology, with applications in optical communication. The best precision for optical-phase tracking has until now been limited by the quantum vacuum fluctuations of coherent light. Here, we surpass this coherent-state limit by using a continuous-wave beam in a phase-squeezed quantum state. Unlike in previous squeezing-enhanced metrology, restricted to phases with very small variation, the best tracking precision (for a fixed light intensity) is achieved for a finite degree of squeezing because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. By optimizing the squeezing, we track the phase with a mean square error 15 $\pm$ 4\% below the coherent-state limit.
A quantum mechanical technique is developed to enhance the phase tracking of photons.

The strong consistency and asymptotic efficiency of AQSE have been mathematically proven [A. Fujiwara, J. Phys. A 39, 12489 (2006)]. In this Letter, the angle of linear polarization of single photons, the phase parameter between the right and the left circularly polarization, is estimated using AQSE, and the strong consistency and asymptotic efficiency are experimentally verified. AQSE will provide a general useful method in both quantum information processing and metrology.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of control theory in quantum mechanics has created a rich, new interdisciplinary scientific field, which is producing novel insight into important theoretical questions at the heart of quantum physics. Exploring this emerging subject, Introduction to Quantum Control and Dynamics presents the mathematical concepts and fundamental physics behind the analysis and control of quantum dynamics, emphasizing the application of Lie algebra and Lie group theory.After introducing the basics of quantum mechanics, the book derives a class of models for quantum control systems from fundamental physics. It examines the controllability and observability of quantum systems and the related problem of quantum state determination and measurement. The author also uses Lie group decompositions as tools to analyze dynamics and to design control algorithms. In addition, he describes various other control methods and discusses topics in quantum information theory that include entanglement and entanglement dynamics. The final chapter covers the implementation of quantum control and dynamics in several fields.Armed with the basics of quantum control and dynamics, readers will invariably use this interdisciplinary knowledge in their mathematical, physics, and engineering work.},

	Abstract = {Two non-directly interacting qubits with equal frequencies can become entangled via a Markovian, dissipative dynamics through the action of a weakly coupled Ohmic heat bath. In the standard weak-coupling limit derivation, this purely dissipative effect disappears if the frequencies are different because of the "ergodic average" used by this approach. However, there are physical situations where this technique is too rough to capture all the relevant aspects of the dissipative dynamics. In these cases, in order to better describe the physical behavior of the open system, it is necessary to go beyond the "ergodic average". We show that, in this more refined framework, the entanglement capability of the environment persists also in the case of different frequencies.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating a classical parameter encoded in a quantum channel, assuming the most general strategy allowed by quantum mechanics. This strategy is based on the exploitation of an unlimited amount of pre-shared entanglement plus the use of adaptive probings, where the input of the channel is interactively updated during the protocol. We show that, for the wide class of teleportation-covariant channels in arbitrary dimension, including Pauli, erasure, and bosonic Gaussian channels, the quantum Fisher information cannot exceed an ultimate bound given by the Choi matrix of the encoding channel. In particular, we show that the adaptive estimation of the noise parameters of a teleportation-covariant channel cannot beat the standard quantum limit, therefore establishing a new intimate connection between teleportation and quantum metrology. We also extend our methods and results to quantum channel discrimination, finding a corresponding ultimate bound for the minimum error probability.},

	Abstract = {Entanglement is a resource central to quantum information (QI). In particular, entanglement shared between two distant parties allows them to do certain tasks that would otherwise be impossible. In this context, we study the effect on the available entanglement of physical restrictions on the local operations that can be performed by the two parties. We enforce these physical restrictions by generalized superselection rules (SSRs), which we define to be associated with a given group of physical transformations. Specifically the generalized SSR is that the local operations must be covariant with respect to that group. Then we operationally define the entanglement constrained by a SSR, and show that it may be far below that expected on the basis of a naive (or ``fluffy bunny'') calculation. We consider two examples. The first is a particle number SSR. Using this we show that for a two-mode BEC (with Alice owning mode \$A\$ and Bob mode \$B\$), the useful entanglement shared by Alice and Bob is identically zero. The second, a SSR associated with the symmetric group, is applicable to ensemble QI processing such as in liquid-NMR. We prove that even for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, with each pair described by a pure Bell state, the entanglement per pair constrained by this SSR goes to zero for a large ensemble.},

Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm in optical coating technology based on direct-bonded monocrystalline multilayers, which exhibit both intrinsically low mechanical loss and high optical quality. Employing these âcrystalline coatingsâ as end mirrors in a FabryâPÃ©rot cavity, we obtain a finesse of 150,000. More importantly, at room temperature, we observe a thermally limited noise floor consistent with a tenfold reduction in mechanical damping when compared with the best dielectric multilayers.

Thanks to the optical frequency comb technique, which established a coherent link between optical and radio frequencies, optical clocks have attracted increasing interest as regards future atomic clocks with superior precision. To date, single trapped ions and ultracold neutral atoms in free fall have shown record high performance that is approaching that of the best Cs fountain clocks. Here we report a different approach, in which atoms trapped in an optical lattice serve as quantum references. The 'optical lattice clock' demonstrates a linewidth one order of magnitude narrower than that observed for neutral-atom optical clocks, and its stability is better than that of single-ion clocks. The transition frequency for the Sr lattice clock is 429,228,004,229,952(15) Hz, as determined by an optical frequency comb referenced to the SI second.},

To date, individual atomic clocks have achieved a 10â18 level of total uncertainties, but a two-clock comparison at the 10â18 level has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate optical lattice clocks with 87Sr atoms interrogated in a cryogenic environment to address the blackbody radiation-induced frequency shift, which remains the primary source of systematic uncertainty and has initiated vigorous theoretical and experimental investigations. The systematic uncertainty for the cryogenic clock is evaluated to be 7.2 Ã 10â18, which is expedited by operating two such cryo-clocks synchronously. After 11 measurements performed over a month, statistical agreement between the two cryo-clocks reached 2.0 Ã 10â18. Such clocks' reproducibility is a major step towards developing accurate clocks at the low 10â18 level, and is directly applicable as a means for relativistic geodesy.},

	abstract = {Tick, Tick, Tickâ¦
Many aspects of everyday life from communication to navigation rely on the precise ticking of the microwave transitions of the atoms in atomic clocks. Optical transitions occur at much higher frequency and so offer the opportunity to reduce the scale of the ticks even more. Hinkley et al. (p. 1215, published online 22 August; see the Perspective by Margolis) compare the ticking of two optical clocks and report an instability near the 10â18 level. Such performance will improve tests of general relativity and pave the way for a redefinition of the second.
Atomic clocks have been instrumental in science and technology, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advanced communications, and tests of fundamental constant variation. Timekeeping precision at 1 part in 1018 enables new timing applications in relativistic geodesy, enhanced Earth- and space-based navigation and telescopy, and new tests of physics beyond the standard model. Here, we describe the development and operation of two optical lattice clocks, both using spin-polarized, ultracold atomic ytterbium. A measurement comparing these systems demonstrates an unprecedented atomic clock instability of 1.6 Ã 10â18 after only 7 hours of averaging.
An ytterbium-based optical clock exhibits a precision of nearly one part per quintillion. [Also see Perspective by Margolis]

Well-established, satellite-based techniques for microwave dissemination are not adequate to compare optical clocks. Here, we present phase-stabilized distribution of an optical frequency over 920 kilometers of telecommunication fiber. We used two antiparallel fiber links to determine their fractional frequency instability (modified Allan deviation) to 5 Ã 10â15 in a 1-second integration time, reaching 10â18 in less than 1000 seconds. For long integration times Ï, the deviation from the expected frequency value has been constrained to within 4 Ã 10â19.

Although the galaxy does gradually join the expansion of the universe (Hubble flow), it does not necessarily recede from us. In particular, in the currently favored cosmological model, which includes a cosmological constant, the galaxy recedes from the observer as it joins the Hubble flow, but in the previously favored cold dark matter model, the galaxy approaches, passes through the observer, and joins the Hubble flow on the opposite side of the sky. We show that this behavior is consistent with the general relativistic idea that space is expanding and is determined by the acceleration of the expansion of the universe -- not a force or drag associated with the expansion itself. We also show that objects at a constant proper distance will have a nonzero redshift; receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching galaxies can be redshifted.},

If the average density in the vacuole is large the boundary shows a blueshift. Evidence is presented that we may be living in a vacuole approximating to the local group of galaxies.

The given uncertainty is the 10 times enlarged formal error of the least-squares estimate and so accounts for possible systematic errors of measurements and deficiencies of the mathematical model. The reliability of this estimate as well as its physical meaning are discussed. A priori most plausible attribution of this effect to the cosmological expansion of the Universe turns out inadequate. A model of the observables developed in the frame of the relativistic background metric of the uniform isotropic Universe shows that the corresponding dynamical perturbations in the major planet motions are completely canceled out by the Einstein effect of dependence of the rate of the observerâs clock (that keeps the proper time) on the gravitational field, though separately values of these two effects are quite large and attainable with the accuracy achieved. Another tentative source of the secular rate of AU is the loss of the solar mass due to the solar wind and electromagnetic radiation but it amounts in ddtAUddtAU\{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\} {\textbackslash}over \{\{{\textbackslash}rm d\} t\}\} \{{\textbackslash}rm AU\} only to 0.3 m/cy. Excluding other explanations that seem exotic (such as secular decrease of the gravitational constant) at present there is no satisfactory explanation of the detected secular increase of AU, at least in the frame of the considered uniform models of the Universe.},

	abstract = {While the slogan “no measurement without disturbance” has established itself under the name of the Heisenberg effect in the consciousness of the scientifically interested public, a precise statement of this fundamental feature of the quantum world has remained elusive, and serious attempts at rigorous formulations of it as a consequence of quantum theory have led to seemingly conflicting preliminary results. Here we show that despite recent claims to the contrary [L. Rozema et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 100404 (2012)], Heisenberg-type inequalities can be proven that describe a tradeoff between the precision of a position measurement and the necessary resulting disturbance of momentum (and vice versa). More generally, these inequalities are instances of an uncertainty relation for the imprecisions of any joint measurement of position and momentum. Measures of error and disturbance are here defined as figures of merit characteristic of measuring devices. As such they are state independent, each giving worst-case estimates across all states, in contrast to previous work that is concerned with the relationship between error and disturbance in an individual state.},

            A quantum system being observed evolves more slowly. This "quantum Zeno effect" is reviewed with respect to a previous attempt of demonstration, and to subsequent criticism of the significance of the findings. A recent experiment on an individual cold trapped ion has been capable of revealing the micro-state of this quantum system, such that the effect of measurement is indeed discriminated from dephasing of the quantum state by either the meter or the environment.},

Diese Ungenauigkeit ist der eigentliche Grund für das Auftreten statistischer Zusammenhänge in der Quantenmechanik. Ihre mathematische Formulierung gelingt mittels der Dirac-Jordanschen Theorie (§ 2). Von den so gewonnenen Grundsätzen ausgehend wird gezeigt, wie die makroskopischen Vorgänge aus der Quantenmechanik heraus verstanden werden können (§ 3).

According to quantum mechanics, a vacuum is not empty space. A consequence of the uncertainly principle is that particles or energy can come into existence for a fleeting moment. Such vacuum or quantum fluctuations are known to exist, but evidence for them has been indirect. Riek et al. present an ultrafast optical based technique that probes the vacuum fluctuation of electromagnetic radiation directly.
Science, this issue p. 420
The ground state of quantum systems is characterized by zero-point motion. This motion, in the form of vacuum fluctuations, is generally considered to be an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The ground-state electric-field variance is inversely proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume, which we sampled electro-optically with tightly focused laser pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. Subcycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach to quantum physics, with nondestructive access to the quantum state of light. Operating at multiterahertz frequencies, such techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter.
Ultrafast optics can directly probe the electric-field vacuum fluctuations.

The gravitational field of a beam of light in the short wavelength approximation has been studied by several authors.

Then, novel features of the gravitational field of a laser beam become apparent, such as frame-dragging due to its spin angular momentum and the deflection of parallel co-propagating test beams that overlap with the source beam. Even though the effects are too small to be detected with current technology, they are of conceptual interest, revealing the gravitational properties of light.},

	abstract = {The effect of gravity and proper acceleration on the frequency spectrum of an optical resonator—both rigid or deformable—is considered in the framework of general relativity. The optical resonator is modeled either as a rod of matter connecting two mirrors or as a dielectric rod whose ends function as mirrors. Explicit expressions for the frequency spectrum are derived for the case that it is only perturbed slightly and variations are slow enough to avoid any elastic resonances of the rod. For a deformable resonator, the perturbation of the frequency spectrum depends on the speed of sound in the rod supporting the mirrors. A connection is found to a relativistic concept of rigidity when the speed of sound approaches the speed of light. In contrast, the corresponding result for the assumption of Born rigidity is recovered when the speed of sound becomes infinite. The results presented in this article can be used as the basis for the description of optical and opto-mechanical systems in a curved spacetime. We apply our results to the examples of a uniformly accelerating resonator and an optical resonator in the gravitational field of a small moving sphere. To exemplify the applicability of our approach beyond the framework of linearized gravity, we consider the fictitious situation of an optical resonator falling into a black hole.},

Furthermore, our result proves that the employed combination of a bright coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state is generally the optimum practical approach for phase estimation with high precision on absolute scales. Based on our analysis we conclude that the application of neither Fock states nor NOON states nor any other sophisticated nonclassical quantum state would have yielded an appreciably higher quantum-noise-limited sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Nearly a century after Einstein first predicted the existence of gravitational waves, a global network of Earth-based gravitational wave observatories is seeking to directly detect this faint radiation using precision laser interferometry. Photon shot noise, due to the quantum nature of light, imposes a fundamental limit on the attometre-level sensitivity of the kilometre-scale Michelson interferometers deployed for this task. Here, we inject squeezed states to improve the performance of one of the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) beyond the quantum noise limit, most notably in the frequency region down to 150 Hz, critically important for several astrophysical sources, with no deterioration of performance observed at any frequency. With the injection of squeezed states, this LIGO detector demonstrated the best broadband sensitivity to gravitational waves ever achieved, with important implications for observing the gravitational-wave Universe with unprecedented sensitivity.

After introducing the subject material and outlining the essential toolbox of continuous variable systems, we define the basic notions needed to understand Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. In particular, emphasis is placed on the mathematical structure combining notions of algebra and symplectic geometry fundamental to a complete understanding of Gaussian informatics. Furthermore, we discuss the quantification of different forms of correlations (including entanglement and quantum discord) for Gaussian states, paying special attention to recently developed measures. The paper is concluded by succinctly expressing the main Gaussian state limitations and outlining a selection of possible future lines for quantum information processing with continuous variable systems.},

Our results show that in the ideal case of photon number detectors with unit quantum efficiency the best configuration is the symmetric one, namely, passive (active) interferometer with passive (active) detection stage: in this case one may achieve Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity by suitably optimizing over Gaussian states at the input. On the other hand, in the realistic case of detectors with non unit quantum efficiency, the performances of passive scheme are unavoidably degraded, whereas detectors involving optical parametric amplifiers allow to fully compensate the presence of loss in the detection stage, thus restoring the Heisenberg scaling.},

	abstract = {A long optical path has been folded between two 7.5-cm diam spherical or aspherical mirrors to provide an output beam which can be well separated from previous reflections with 1000 or more passes between the mirrors. The 3000-m path provides 10 psec of delay. This system can be used as a dispersionless optical delay line for use in filtering or storage of information modulated onto the light beam. The pat- tern of beams between the two mirrors is obtained in one of two ways. A small perturbing mirror may be inserted to give a series of offset ellipses, or one or both of the mirrors can be made astigmatic to give a Lissajous pattern of spots on each mirror. The output beam can be separated from others by dis- criminating in both angle and position. The diffraction losses of the system are much lower than those for an open beam because of the periodic focusing of the spherical mirrors. The extreme dependence of the loss of the delay line upon the absorption and scattering loss of the mirrors makes the system de- pendent upon very low loss mirrors and also makes the system a suitable method for measuring mirror loss.

	title = {Statistical Dynamics of Quantum Oscillators and Parametric Amplification in a Single Mode},
	abstract = {The description of the statistical dynamics of quantum oscillators is formulated in terms
of the Wigner distribution, analogous to the more commonly used P distribution, with ex- plicit formulas being obtained for its time evolution and for average values. This formula- tion is desirable because, e.g. , the Wigner distribution always exists whereas the P distribu- tion does not. The formalism is applied to the process of parametric amplification in a single mode, which may be considered as the degenerate form of the well-known two-mode case. This degeneracy gives rise to significantly different properties; for example, the P distribu- tion for the single mode of interest evolves from a circularly symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian into an elliptically symmetric form and ceases to exist after a finite time, even for amplification in the presence of losses. This is contrary to the two-mode case. The cor- responding Wigner distribution is found to exist as a well-behaved function for aO time as ex- pected, regardless of the amount of losses, and is used to calculate average values of various quantities of interest. It is found, e.g. , that. in the lossless case the average number of photons in the signal mode always becomes infinite as t-~. This is in contrast to the cor- responding classical result for the lossless case which allows the signal to decay rather
than to grow with time, depending on the relative phase between the signal and the pump.
Field fluctuations are discussed and found to have some unusual properties. The combina- tion of frequency up-conversion with single-mode amplification is also described briefly.
The effect of the quantization of the pump oscillator is considered in an Appendix.},

We assume that the unitary part of the dynamics is represented by Gaussian operations which preserve the Gaussian nature of the quantum state, i.e. arbitrary phase rotations, bounded squeezing and unlimited displacements. In the ideal ansatz of unconstrained quantum control (i.e. when the unitary phase rotations, squeezing and displacement of the mode can be performed instantaneously), we study how control can be optimized for speeding up the relaxation towards the fixed point of the dynamics and we analytically derive the optimal relaxation time. Our model has potential and interesting applications to the control of modes of electromagnetic radiation and of trapped levitated nanospheres.},

The rate of decoherence is quantified by relating it to the decay rates of various, complementary measures of the quantum nature of a state, such as the purity, some non-classicality indicators in phase space, and, for two-mode states, entanglement measures and total correlations between the modes. Different sets of physically relevant initial configurations are considered, including one- and two-mode Gaussian states, number states, and coherent superpositions. Our analysis shows that, generally, the use of initially squeezed configurations does not help to preserve the coherence of Gaussian states, whereas it can be effective in protecting coherent superpositions of both number states and Gaussian wavepackets.},

Recent intense efforts have focused on understanding synchronization in quantum systems without clear semi-classical limits but no comprehensive theory providing a systematic basis for the underlying physical mechanisms has yet been found. Through a complete characterization of the non-decaying persistently oscillating eigenmodes of smooth quantum evolutions corresponding to quantum limit cycles, we provide a general algebraic theory of quantum synchronization which provides detailed criteria for various types of synchronization to occur. These results constitute the previously absent framework within which to pursue a structured study of quantum synchronization. This framework enables us to study both stable synchronization which lasts for infinitely long times limit, and metastable synchronization which lasts for long, but finite, times. Moreover, we give compact algebraic criteria that may be checked in a given system to prove the absence of synchronization. We use our theory to demonstrate the anti-synchronization of two spin-1/2's and discuss synchronization in the Fermi-Hubbard model and its generalisations which are relevant for various fermionic cold atom experiments, including multi-species, multi-orbital and higher spin atoms.},

In the electromagnetic case, we show that the quantization of electromagnetic radiation (which causes decoherence of Alice’s particle) and vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (which limits Bob’s ability to localize his particle to better than a charge-radius), both are essential for avoiding apparent paradoxes with causality and complementarity. We then analyze the gravitational version of this Gedankenexperiment. We correct an error in the analysis of Mari et al. [Sci. Rep. 6, 22777 (2016).] and of Baym and Ozawa [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 3035 (2009).], who did not properly account for the conservation of center of mass of an isolated system. We show that the analysis of the gravitational case is in complete parallel with the electromagnetic case, provided that gravitational radiation is quantized and that vacuum fluctuations limit the localization of a particle to no better than a Planck length. This provides support for the view that (linearized) gravity should have a quantum field description.},

Over an integration time of 350 hours the test mass oscillator enables measurements with a systematic accuracy of 4E-11m/s{\textasciicircum}2 and a statistical precision of 4E-12m/s{\textasciicircum}2. This is sufficient to resolve the gravitational signal at a minimal surface distance of 400mum between the two masses. We observe both linear and quadratic coupling, consistent in signal strength with a time-varying 1/r gravitational potential. Contributions of non-gravitational forces could be kept to less than 10\% of the observed signal. We expect further improvements to enable the isolation of gravity as a coupling force for objects well below the Planck mass.

	abstract = {Measuring tiny forces with atomic clouds
For projects such as detecting gravity waves, physicists need to measure tiny forces precisely. Schreppler et al. developed an extremely sensitive method for force measurement. They applied a known force on a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity. The force caused the atoms to oscillate, and the researchers used optical measurements to monitor the motion. Under optimal conditions, the authors could measure forces with a level of sensitivity only four times worse than the fundamental limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Science, this issue p. 1486
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the noise in a force measurement based on continuously detecting a mechanical oscillator’s position. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can be reached when the oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment and when measurement imprecision from photon shot noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement back-action. We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically. When the driving force is resonant with the cloud’s oscillation frequency, we achieve a sensitivity that is a factor of 4 above the standard quantum limit and consistent with theoretical predictions given the atoms’ residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency.
A very sensitive force-measuring technique uses ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity as a mechanical oscillator.

Test rays moving parallel to the pencil or pulse do so with uniform unit velocity the same as that in the pencil or pulse itself. Test rays moving in other directions experience a gravitational action. A test particle placed at a point equally distant from the two ends of a pencil experiences no acceleration parallel to the pencil, but is accelerated towards the pencil by twice the amount which would be calculated from a simple application of the Newtonian theory. The result is satisfactory from the point of view of the conservation of momentum.

Here, we use a near-concentric cavity to focus 7.5 kW of continuous-wave circulating laser power at 1064 nm into a 7 \&\#x000B5;m mode waist, achieving a record continuous laser intensity of 40 GW/cm2. Such parameters are sufficient to impart a phase shift of 1 rad to a 10 keV electron beam, or 0.16 rad to a 300 keV beam.

Under suitable conditions, and even in the presence of detuning between the natural precession frequencies of the two spins, they are shown to reach a long-lasting transient behavior where they oscillate in phase. We explore the connection between the emergence of such a behavior and the establishment of robust quantum correlations between the two spins, analyzing differences between dissipative and dephasing effects. In particular, in the regime in which synchronization occurs, quantum correlations are more robust for shorter synchronization times and this is related to a separation between system decay rates.},

	abstract = {A common environment acting on two superconducting qubits can give rise to a plethora of phenomena, such as the generation of entanglement between the qubits that, beyond its importance for quantum computation tasks, also enforces a change of strategy in quantum error correction protocols. Further effects induced by a common bath are quantum synchronization and subradiance. Contrary to entanglement, for which full-state tomography is necessary, the latter can be assessed by detection of local observables only. In this work we explore different regimes to establish when synchronization and subradiance can be employed as reliable signatures of an entangling common bath. Moreover, we address a recently proposed measure of the collectiveness of the dynamics driven by the bath, and find that it almost perfectly witnesses the behavior of entanglement. Finally, we propose an implementation of the model based on two transmon qubits capacitively coupled to a common resistor, which may be employed as a versatile quantum simulation platform of the open system in general regimes.},

	abstract = {The transverse coherent motion of the two colliding LHC beams is studied by multiparticle tracking, where the beam-beam force is calculated assuming a Gaussian beam distribution with variable barycentres and rms beam sizes. The simulation yields the coherent and incoherent oscillation frequencies, the emittance growth of either beam, and evidence for the existence or lack of Landau damping. The transverse beam sizes change with the fractional part of the tune as expected from the dynamic beta eﬀect. For head-on collisions, we ﬁnd that the π-mode frequency lies outside of the continuum frequency spread if the ratio of the beam-beam parameters exceeds 0.6, in accordance with predictions [1]. For smaller ratios, the π-mode is Landau damped. When long range interactions are also included, undamped coherent modes do still exist outside the continuum, both with and without alternating crossing planes at two interaction points. However, the simulation shows that separating the tunes of the two beams can restore the Landau damping.},

The beam-beam effect in the LHC is further complicated by a large number of bunches (2808 per beam), a ﬁnite crossing angle and gaps in the bunch train. The coherent beam-beam effects under various conditions and operational scenarios are studied analytically and with multiparticle simulations.

Transition from the weak-strong to the strong-strong cases is found at the intensity ratio of about 60\% when a discrete p-mode frequency emerges from continuum of eigenfrequencies related to the beam-beam tunespread in the weaker bunch. In the strong-strong case the large coherent beam-beam tuneshift dominates over interchange processes between coherent and incoherent motion; it can switch off Landau damping of dipole transverse oscillations, slows down incoherent emittance growth due to external kicks on the beams.

	abstract = {The existing CERN accelerator infrastructure is world unique and its research capacity should be fully exploited. In the coming decade its principal modus operandi will be focused on producing intense proton beams, accelerating and colliding them at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with the highest achievable luminosity. This activity should, in our view, be complemented by new initiatives and their feasibility studies targeted on re-using the existing CERN accelerator complex in novel ways that were not conceived when the machines were designed. They should provide attractive, ready-to-implement research options for the forthcoming paradigm-shift phase of the CERN research. This paper presents one of the case studies of the Gamma Factory initiative (Krasny, 2015) – a proposal of a new operation scheme of ion beams in the CERN accelerator complex. Its goal is to extend the scope and precision of the LHC-based research by complementing the proton–proton collision programme with the high-luminosity nucleus–nucleus one. Its numerous physics highlights include studies of the exclusive Higgs-boson production in photon–photon collisions and precision measurements of the electroweak (EW) parameters. There are two principal ways to increase the LHC luminosity which do not require an upgrade of the CERN injectors: (1) modification of the beam-collision optics and (2) reduction of the transverse emittance of the colliding beams. The former scheme is employed by the ongoing high-luminosity (HL-LHC) project. The latter one, applicable only to ion beams, is proposed in this paper. It is based on laser cooling of bunches of partially stripped ions at the SPS flat-top energy. For isoscalar calcium beams, which fulfil the present beam-operation constrains and which are particularly attractive for the EW physics, the transverse beam emittance can be reduced by a factor of 5 within the 8 seconds long cooling phase. The predicted nucleon–nucleon luminosity of LNN=4.2×1034s−1cm−2 for collisions of the cooled calcium beams at the LHC top energy is comparable to the levelled luminosity for the HL-LHC proton–proton collisions, but with reduced pile-up background. The scheme proposed in this paper, if confirmed by the future Gamma Factory proof-of-principle experiment, could be implemented at CERN with minor infrastructure investments.},

The usual heating due to intra-beam collisions should completely vanish, giving rise to a state of unprecedented brilliance. Despite a continuous improvement of beam cooling techniques, such as electron cooling and laser cooling, the ultimate goal5 of beam crystallization has not yet been reached in high-energy storage rings. Electron-cooled dilute beams of highly charged ions show liquid-like order6,7 with unique applications8. An experiment5 using laser cooling9,10 suggested a reduction of intra-beam heating, although the results were ambiguous. Here we demonstrate the crystallization of laser-cooled Mg+ beams circulating in the radiofrequency quadrupole storage ring PALLAS11,12 at a velocity of 2,800 m s-1, which corresponds to a beam energy of 1 eV. A sudden collapse of the transverse beam size and the low longitudinal velocity spread clearly indicate the phase transition. The continuous ring-shaped crystalline beam shows exceptional stability, surviving for more than 3,000 revolutions without cooling.},

	abstract = {The renewed serious interest to possible practical applications of gravitational waves is encouraging. Building on previous work, I am arguing that the strong variable electromagnetic fields are appropriate systems for the generation and detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The advantages of electromagnetic systems are clearly seen in the proposed complete laboratory experiment, where one has to ensure the efficiency of, both, the process of generation and the process of detection of HFGW. Within the family of electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible geometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic field, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years ago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability is at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can remove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory experiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the cost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic systems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe the stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the opposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely valuable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on, the high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin of relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency signal, and the existing estimates of its detectability.},

	abstract = {A successful experiment combining emission and reception of gravitational waves (GWs) would constitute a premiere of gravity control. However, such experiments manipulating gravity would require to compactly store large amounts of energy while using ultra-sensitive detection techniques and hence can be expected to be very difficult to realise. In this paper, we first propose new designs of electromagnetic (EM) generators allowing directional emission of GWs. They are based on the resonant amplification of GWs occuring when EM standing waves couple to an external static magnetic field. The interplay between the EM polarizations, the orientation of the boosting magnetic field and the emitted GW polarizations is studied, as well as the gravitational radiation patterns of the different generators. Then, we develop a new GW directional detection method based on magnetic energy storage. Three possible applications are presented: (i) indirect detection of GW emission by high-accuracy monitoring of the energy loss in the generators ; (ii) direct detection of an incoming plane GW with a high-field magnet and (iii) GW emission-reception experiments. Although current technology allows reaching detection thresholds in these experiments, their practical realisation would still need to overcome several key technical challenges.},

	abstract = {Superconducting microwave cavities have been proposed for the detection of gravitational waves in the high frequency range of the spectrum. The interaction of the gravitational wave with the cavity walls, and the resulting motion, induces the transition of some electromagnetic energy from an initially excited cavity mode to an empty one. The energy transfer is maximum when the frequency of the wave is equal to the frequency difference of the two cavity modes. In this paper, some ideas for the development of a tunable detector of gravitational waves around 10 kHz are discussed; the outline of a possible detector design and its expected sensitivity are also shown.},

Moreover, the vibration amplitude must be measured over and over again without perturbing it (quantum nondemolition measurement). This contrasts with quantum chemistry, quantum optics, or atomic, nuclear, and elementary particle physics, where one usually makes measurements on an ensemble of identical objects and does not care whether any single object is perturbed or destroyed by the measurement. This article describes the new electronic techniques required for quantum nondemolition measurements and the theory underlying them.

We show that there is a steplike crossover to a synchronized state as a function of the driving strength. In contrast to the classical case, there is a finite threshold value in driving. Quantum noise reduces the synchronized region and leads to a deviation from strict frequency locking.},

For any quantum channel acting on a state of a given size, one defines the complementary channel, which sends the input state into the state of the environment after the operation. Making use of subadditivity of entropy, we show that for any dimension the sum of both entropies is bounded from below. This result characterizes the trade-off between the information on the initial quantum state accessible to the principal system and the information leaking to the environment. For one qubit maps we describe the interpolating family of depolarizing maps, for which the sum of both entropies gives the lower boundary of the region allowed in the space spanned by both entropies.},

We analyze this setup in terms of the geometry of unital positive but not completely positive qubit-maps, arising from the mixture of qubit channels and steering maps. We find the range of mixing parameters that can generate given correlations, and prove a quantum advantage in a more general setup, allowing arbitrary unital channels and initial states with fully mixed reduced states. This is achieved by establishing new bounds on signed singular values of sums of matrices. Based on the geometry, we quantify and identify the origin of the quantum advantage depending on the observed correlations, and discuss how additional constraints can lead to a unique solution of the problem.},

	abstract = {Wave-particle duality is one of the basic features of quantum mechanics, giving rise to the use of complex numbers in describing states of quantum systems, their dynamics, and interaction. Since the inception of quantum theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are actually essential, or whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem both theoretically and experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show that - under reasonable assumptions - quantum states are easier to create and manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important questions which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and all pure states of any dimension, and the approximate imaginarity distillation for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a crucial role for state discrimination: there exist real quantum states which can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical communication, but which cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon experimentally with linear optics, performing discrimination of different two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. These results prove that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.},

We introduce the notion of the volatility of quantum information and show that indeed the conditions for it are naturally satisfied in the quantum teleportation protocol. We argue that even if special relativity principles are not assumed, it is possible to make quantum information volatile.

Realistic true random events are acts of pure creation that obey strict laws, but do not necessarily satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms of probabilities. Realistic true randomness is some sort of nondeterministic force, or propensity of physical systems to manifest such and such properties under such and such conditions. Realistic random events reflect preexisting properties, as required by realism, simply the reflection is not deterministic; still, the preexisting properties determine the propensities of the different possible events. It is argued that deterministic extensions of quantum physics are necessarily incompatible with special relativity. Hence, from today's violations of Bell's inequalities one can conclude that all future physics theories will display true randomness as does quantum physics. It is argued that accepting true randomness and realism leads to new questions with interesting answers, allowing one 1) to study nonlocality in configurations with many independent sources and 2) to bound how much free will is needed for a proper violation of Bell's inequality.},

In particular, it is shown that chi-square tests of simple and of some composite hypotheses are inferior, in the sense described, to the corresponding likelihood ratio tests.

For this reason, the focus of this dissertation is on the development of quantum-computing applications and robust, scalable quantum-architectures. I begin by presenting an overview of the language of quantum computation. I then, in joint work with Ojas Parekh, analyze the performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on a graph problem called Max Cut. Next, I present a new stabilizer simulation algorithm that gives improved runtime performance for topological stabilizer codes. After that, in joint work with Andrew Landahl, I present a new set of procedures for performing logical operations called "color-code lattice-surgery." Finally, I describe a software package I developed for studying, developing, and evaluating quantum error-correcting codes under realistic noise.},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

However, as yet, little is known about concrete MIW models for more than one spatial dimension and/or more than one particle. In this work we develop the MIW approach further to treat arbitrary degrees of freedom, and provide a systematic study of a corresponding numerical implementation for computing one-particle ground and excited states in one dimension, and ground states in two spatial dimensions.

We characterize the general structure of causal complete-measurement superoperators, and exhibit examples that are causal but not localizable. We construct another class of causal bipartite superoperators that are not localizable by invoking bounds on the strength of correlations among the parts of a quantum system. A bipartite superoperator is said to be semilocalizable if it can be implemented with one-way quantum communication from Alice to Bob, and it is semicausal if it conveys no information from Bob to Alice. We show that all semicausal complete-measurement superoperators are semilocalizable, and we establish a general criterion for semicausality.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02481},
	abstract = {Inspired by the developments in quantum computing, building quantum-inspired classical hardware to solve computationally hard problems has been receiving increasing attention. By introducing systematic sparsification techniques, we propose and demonstrate a massively parallel architecture, termed sIM or the sparse Ising Machine. Exploiting the sparsity of the resultant problem graphs, the sIM achieves ideal parallelism: the key figure of merit \$-\$ flips per second \$-\$ scales linearly with the total number of probabilistic bits (p-bit) in the system. This makes sIM up to 6 orders of magnitude faster than a CPU implementing standard Gibbs sampling. When compared to optimized implementations in TPUs and GPUs, the sIM delivers up to {\textasciitilde} 5 - 18x measured speedup. In benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as integer factorization, the sIM can reliably factor semi-primes up to 32-bits, far larger than previous attempts from D-Wave and other probabilistic solvers. Strikingly, the sIM beats competition-winning SAT solvers (by up to {\textasciitilde} 4 - 700x in runtime to reach 95\% accuracy) in solving hard instances of the 3SAT problem. A surprising observation is that even when the asynchronous sampling is made inexact with simultaneous updates using faster clocks, sIM can find the correct ground state with further speedup. The problem encoding and sparsification techniques we introduce can be readily applied to other Ising Machines (classical and quantum) and the asynchronous architecture we present can be used for scaling the demonstrated 5,000\$-\$10,000 p-bits to 1,000,000 or more through CMOS or emerging nanodevices.},

	abstract = {The probability relations which can occur between two separated physical systems are discussed, on the assumption that their state is known by a representative in common. The two families of observables, relating to the first and to the second system respectively, are linked by at least one match between two definite members, one of either family. The word match is short for stating that the values of the two observables in question determine each other uniquely and therefore (since the actual labelling is irrelevant) can be taken to be equal. In general there is but one match, but there can be more. If, in addition to the first match, there is a second one between canonical conjugates of the first mates, then there are infinitely many matches, every function of the first canonical pair matching with the same function of the second canonical pair. Thus there is a complete one-to-one correspondence between those two branches (of the two families of observables) which relate to the two degrees of freedom in question. If there are no others, the one-to-one correspondence persists as time advances, but the observables of the first system (say) change their mates in the way that the latter, i.e. the observables of the second system, undergo a certain continuous contact-transformation.},

Precision in these experiments is strongly limited by the 1/√N shot noise factor with N being the number of probes (photons, atoms) employed in the experiment. Quantum theory provides tools to overcome the bound by using entangled probes. In an idealized scenario this gives rise to the Heisenberg scaling of precision 1/N. Here we show that when decoherence is taken into account, the maximal possible quantum enhancement in the asymptotic limit of infinite N amounts generically to a constant factor rather than quadratic improvement. We provide efficient and intuitive tools for deriving the bounds based on the geometry of quantum channels and semi-definite programming. We apply these tools to derive bounds for models of decoherence relevant for metrological applications including: depolarization, dephasing, spontaneous emission and photon loss.},

	abstract = {A nonlinear interferometer uses nonlinear elements as beam splitters to split and to recombine optical waves for interference. As a result, the interference fringe size has a nonlinear dependence on the intensity of the field for phase sensing and leads to an enhanced phase signal. In this paper, a practical scheme of nonlinear interferometry for precision phase measurement is analyzed with parametric amplifiers as the nonlinear beam splitters. It is found that the signal due to phase shift is enhanced by a factor of the amplification gain as compared to a linear interferometer with the same phase-sensing light intensity while the quantum noise is kept at the vacuum level, thus, effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beyond the standard quantum limit. Furthermore, the scheme is not as sensitive to the detection loss as the linear scheme with a squeezed state for noise reduction. However, losses inside the interferometer limit the enhancement factor in SNR. We apply the concept to a Michelson interferometer but with parametric amplifiers involved for gravitational-wave detection. We find that effective power is increased by the gain of the amplifiers without actually increasing the cycling power inside the interferometer. Furthermore, the full benefits with squeezed input and variational output or the combination of a quantum nondemolition interferometer for sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit apply here with even better results. Such a nonlinear interferometer will find wide applications in precision measurements.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms profit from the interference of quantum states in an exponentially large Hilbert space and the fact that unitary transformations on that Hilbert space can be broken down to universal gates that act only on one or two qubits at the same time. The former aspect renders the direct classical simulation of quantum algorithms difficult. Here we introduce higher-order partial derivatives of a probability distribution of particle positions as a new object that shares these basic properties of quantum mechanical states needed for a quantum algorithm. Discretization of the positions allows one to represent the quantum mechanical state of n bit qubits by 2(n bit + 1) classical stochastic bits. Based on this, we demonstrate many-particle interference and representation of pure entangled quantum states via derivatives of probability distributions and find the universal set of stochastic maps that correspond to the quantum gates in a universal gate set. We prove that the propagation via the stochastic map built from those universal stochastic maps reproduces up to a prefactor exactly the evolution of the quantum mechanical state with the corresponding quantum algorithm, leading to an automated translation of a quantum algorithm to a stochastic classical algorithm. We implement several well-known quantum algorithms, analyse the scaling of the needed number of realizations with the number of qubits, and highlight the role of destructive interference for the cost of the emulation.},

We introduce a broader framework that allows us to derive quantum-mechanical limits on the precision to which a parameter--e.g., elapsed time--may be determined via arbitrary data analysis of arbitrary measurements {onNidentically} prepared quantum systems. The limits are expressed as generalized {Mandelstam-Tamm} uncertainty relations, which involve the operator that generates displacements of the parameter--e.g., the Hamiltonian operator in the case of elapsed time. This approach avoids entirely the problem of associating a Hermitian operator with the parameter. We illustrate the general formalism, first, with nonrelativistic uncertainty relations for spatial displacement and momentum, harmonic-oscillator phase and number of quanta, and time and energy and, second, with Lorentz-invariant uncertainty relations involving the displacement and Lorentz-rotation parameters of the Poincare group.},

This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.},

Here we show that -ray bursts will be sensitive to an energy dispersion predicted by some approaches to quantum gravity. Many of the bursts have structure on relatively rapid timescales, which means that in principle it is possible to look for energy-dependent dispersion of the radiation, manifested in the arrival times of the photons, if several different energy bands are observed simultaneously. A simple estimate indicates that, because of their high energies and distant origin, observations of these bursts should be sensitive to a dispersion scale that is comparable to the Planck energy scale (1019 {GeV}), which is sufficient to test theories of quantum gravity. Such observations are already possible using existing -ray burst detectors.},

Here âlocalâ is taken to mean that the sizes of the considered systems are much smaller than cosmologically relevant scales. For example, such influences can affect orbital motions as well as configurations of compact objects, like black holes. Also discussed are how measurements based on the exchange of electromagnetic signals of distances, velocities, etc. of moving objects are influenced. As an application, orders of magnitude of such effects are compared with the scale set by the apparently anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts, which is 10â9m/s2. There is no reason to believe that the latter is of cosmological origin. However, the general problem of gaining a qualitative and quantitative understanding of how the cosmological dynamics influences local systems remains challenging, with only partial clues being so far provided by exact solutions to the field equations of general relativity.},

Because the class of schemes that are referred to as nonlinear interferometers is too broad, we restrict the consideration to the cases in which crystals, fibers, or atomic systems producing the nonlinear effect are placed inside the interferometer, and only linear phase shifts are imposed. As a nonlinear effect, we consider four-wave mixing and parametric down-conversion, at both low and high gain.},

The phase transition of the beam, laser-cooled at an energy of 1 eV, is observed as a sudden drop in the transverse beam size. The crystalline beam evolves from a linear string of ions to a vertical zigzag band when the bunch is longitudinally compressed. Bunched and coasting beams show similar properties close to the phase transition. Here, the spatial beam profile exhibits an unexpected two-component distribution, possibly due to a phase mixing process.},

But if not, what is the role of the rule? In this paper, the argument is given that it should be seen as an empirical addition to Bayesian reasoning itself. Particularly, it is shown how to view the Born rule as a normative rule in addition to usual Dutch-book coherence. It is a rule that takes into account how one should assign probabilities to the consequences of various intended measurements on a physical system, but explicitly in terms of prior probabilities for and conditional probabilities consequent upon the imagined outcomes of a special counterfactual reference measurement. This interpretation is exemplified by representing quantum states in terms of probabilities for the outcomes of a fixed, fiducial symmetric informationally complete measurement. The extent to which the general form of the new normative rule implies the full state-space structure of quantum mechanics is explored.},

The standard treatment of osmosis in thermodynamics employs the concept of the chemical potential and does not give any clues how the process "really" works. On the other hand one may also encounter conflicting qualitative and molecular explanations of osmosis. We use the case of osmosis in the present paper to elucidate different ways to "explain" and "understand" physical phenomena. The role of qualitative understanding of physical phenomena is emphasized. However, as the case of osmosis demonstrates, there may be a big gap between the abstract macroscopic theory and molecular conceptions of the mechanism.},

These problems arise because it is traditional to emphasize at the outset how general thermodynamics is. Unfortunately, when ideas are introduced in an unspecific context they fail to make contact with the student's experience - such ideas do not become part of the physical intuition of the student. In this introductory text the subject is developed in stages beginning with the basic notions, which are illustrated using an ideal gas as a model system. The generalization of these concepts is achieved first using the classical laws of thermodynamics and second using the formalism of Gibbs to provide a systematic introduction to the thermodynamic potentials. Work processes on polarizable media subject to electric and magnetic fields are discussed and transformations of matter, including phase change processes and chemical reactions, are treated in detail. The book contains many worked examples, and approximately 250 questions, which are keyed to the text. The questions include traditional and applied topics, and longer questions have been programmed to guide the student.},

We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a ‘classical shadow’, can be used to predict many different properties; order \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}{\textbackslash},(M)\$\$measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

	abstract = {Current algorithms for quantum state tomography (QST) are costly both on the experimental front, requiring measurement of many copies of the state, and on the classical computational front, needing a long time to analyze the gathered data. Here, we introduce neural adaptive quantum state tomography (NAQT), a fast, flexible machine-learning-based algorithm for QST that adapts measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. As in other adaptive QST schemes, measurement adaptation makes use of the information gathered from previous measured copies of the state to perform a targeted sensing of the next copy, maximizing the information gathered from that next copy. Our NAQT approach allows for a rapid and seamless integration of measurement adaptation and statistical inference, using a neural-network replacement of the standard Bayes’ update, to obtain the best estimate of the state. Our algorithm, which falls into the machine learning subfield of “meta-learning” (in effect “learning to learn” about quantum states), does not require any ansatz about the form of the state to be estimated. Despite this generality, it can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to larger systems and potential speed-ups if provided with additional structure, such as a state ansatz.},

Although the full simulation of large-scale quantum systems may only be possible on a quantum computer, classical characterization and optimization methods still play an important role. Here, we review different approaches that use classical post-processing techniques, possibly combined with adaptive optimization, to learn quantum systems, their correlation properties, dynamics and interaction with the environment. We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits.

It is also possible to compensate the effect of detection losses which requires, however, extra effort in both experimental and numerical precision.

Since the frequency distributions of the outcomes of any finite number of measurements will generally deviate from their asymptotic limits, the estimates computed by standard methods do not in general coincide with the true state and, therefore, have no operational significance unless their accuracy is defined in terms of error bounds. Here we show that quantum state tomography, together with an appropriate data analysis procedure, yields reliable and tight error bounds, specified in terms of confidence regions—a concept originating from classical statistics. Confidence regions are subsets of the state space in which the true state lies with high probability, independently of any prior assumption on the distribution of the possible states. Our method for computing confidence regions can be applied to arbitrary measurements including fully coherent ones; it is practical and particularly well suited for tomography on systems consisting of a small number of qubits, which are currently in the focus of interest in experimental quantum information science.},

We generalize known results about the approximation of unitary two-designs, i.e. certain classes of random unitary matrices, by random quantum circuits and connect our findings to the theory of quantum compressed sensing. We show that for ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices established experimental techniques such as optical super-lattices, laser speckles and time-of-flight measurements are sufficient to perform fully certified, assumption-free tomography. This is possible without the need to address single sites in any step of the procedure. Combining our approach with tensor network methods—in particular, the theory of matrix product states—we identify situations where the effort of reconstruction is even constant in the number of lattice sites, allowing, in principle, to perform tomography on large-scale systems readily available in present experiments.},

	abstract = {A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized π/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.},

Such elements are estimated as averages over experimental outcomes with a precision that is fixed by the number of repetitions of the experiment. Resources required implementing it scale polynomially with the number of qubits of the system. The estimation of all diagonal elements of the χ matrix can be efficiently done without any ancillary qubits. In turn, the estimation of all the off-diagonal elements requires an extra clean qubit.

It has been realized in systems with few components, but for larger systems it becomes unfeasible because the number of measurements and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in the system size. Here, we present two tomography schemes that scale much more favourably than direct tomography with system size. One of them requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, whereas the other requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing. Both rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and post-processing that is polynomial in the system size. These schemes can be applied to a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that are well approximated by matrix product states. The accuracy of the reconstructed states can be rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.},

This protocol consists of interleaving random Clifford gates between the gate of interest and provides an estimate as well as theoretical bounds for the average error of the gate under test, so long as the average noise variation over all Clifford gates is small. This technique takes into account both state preparation and measurement errors and is scalable in the number of qubits. We apply this protocol to a superconducting qubit system and find a bounded average error of 0.003 [0,0.016] for the single-qubit gates Xπ/2 and Yπ/2. These bounded values provide better estimates of the average error than those extracted via quantum process tomography.},

The quantum volume is linked to system error rates, and is empirically reduced by uncontrolled interactions within the system. It quantifies the largest random circuit of equal width and depth that the computer successfully implements. Quantum computing systems with high-fidelity operations, high connectivity, large calibrated gate sets, and circuit rewriting toolchains are expected to have higher quantum volumes. The quantum volume is a pragmatic way to measure and compare progress toward improved system-wide gate error rates for near-term quantum computation and error-correction experiments.},

	abstract = {Any technology requires precise benchmarking of its components, and the quantum technologies are no exception. Randomized benchmarking allows for the relatively resource economical estimation of the average gate fidelity of quantum gates from the Clifford group, assuming identical noise levels for all gates, making use of suitable sequences of randomly chosen Clifford gates. In this work, we report significant progress on randomized benchmarking, by showing that it can be done for individual quantum gates outside the Clifford group, even for varying noise levels per quantum gate. This is possible at little overhead of quantum resources, but at the expense of a significant classical computational cost. At the heart of our analysis is a representation-theoretic framework that we develop here which is brought into contact with classical estimation techniques based on bootstrapping and matrix pencils. We demonstrate the functioning of the scheme at hand of benchmarking tensor powers of T-gates. Apart from its practical relevance, we expect this insight to be relevant as it highlights the role of assumptions made on unknown noise processes when characterizing quantum gates at high precision.},

State-of-the-art Bayesian tomography solutions suffer from three problems: numerical intractability, a lack of informative prior distributions, and an inability to track time-dependent processes. Here, we address all three problems. First, we use modern statistical methods, as pioneered by Huszár and Houlsby (2012 Phys. Rev. A 85 052120) and by Ferrie (2014 New J. Phys. 16 093035), to make Bayesian tomography numerically tractable. Our approach allows for practical computation of Bayesian point and region estimators for quantum states and channels. Second, we propose the first priors on quantum states and channels that allow for including useful experimental insight. Finally, we develop a method that allows tracking of time-dependent states and estimates the drift and diffusion processes affecting a state.

	abstract = {Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. Firstly, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e. the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Secondly, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. In this paper, we present a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds for the realistic situation where the data contain noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators—the matrix Dantzig selector and the matrix Lasso—with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low-rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation, and describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank and requires only Pauli eigenstate preparations and Pauli measurements.},

Physics however aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. While most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous works showed that such "real quantum theory" can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. Thus, are complex numbers really needed in the quantum formalism? Here, we show this to be case by proving that real and complex quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment whose successful realization would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.},

	abstract = {We consider two interacting systems when one is treated classically while the other system remains quantum. Consistent dynamics of this coupling has been shown to exist, and explored in the context of treating space-time classically. Here, we prove that any such hybrid dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of the quantum system, and a breakdown in predictability in the classical phase space. We further prove that a trade-off between the rate of this decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical quantum dynamics; long coherence times require strong diffusion in phase-space relative to the strength of the coupling. Applying the trade-off relation to gravity, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric and its conjugate momenta. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein’s classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter. We find that part of the parameter space of such theories are already squeezed out, and provide figures of merit which can be used in future mass measurements and interference experiments.},

The sources considered are high energy laser beams in an optical cavity and the ultra-relativistic proton bunches circulating in the beam of the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN. These sources allow for signal frequencies much higher and far narrower in bandwidth than what most celestial sources produce. In addition, by modulating the beams, one can adjust the source frequency over a very broad range, from Hz to GHz. The gravitational field of these sources and responses of a variety of detectors are analyzed. We optimize a mechanical oscillator such as a pendulum or torsion balance as detector and find parameter regimes such that—combined with the planned high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC as a source—a signal-to-noise ratio substantially larger than 1 should be achievable at least in principle, neglecting all sources of technical noise. This opens new perspectives of studying general relativistic effects and possibly quantum-gravitational effects with ultra-relativistic, well-controlled terrestrial sources.},

These connections indicate that QFIM is more than a concept in quantum metrology, but rather a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we summarize the properties and existing calculation techniques of QFIM for various cases, and review the development of QFIM in some aspects of quantum mechanics apart from quantum metrology. On the other hand, as the main application of QFIM, the second part of this paper reviews the quantum multiparameter Cramér–Rao bound, its attainability condition and the associated optimal measurements.

If the wave function of the whole system is known, either part is in the situation of a mixture, which is decomposed into definite constituents by a definite measuring programme to be carried out on the other part. All the conceivable decompositions (into linearly independent constituents) of the first system are just realized by all the possible measuring programmes that can be carried out on the second one. In general every state of the first system can be given a finite chance by a suitable choice of the programme.It is suggested that these conclusions, unavoidable within the present theory but repugnant to some physicists including the author, are caused by applying non-relativistic quantum mechanics beyond its legitimate range.

	abstract = {Writer hopes that the reader will find that some of the ideas or of the theorems of this memoir are new to him. However, as its contents were first intended as a chapter of a course on mathematical statistics, this paper must be judged from the didactic or pedagogical, as well as from the scientific point of view. It is devoted to a critical study and to an extension of some of the methods of estimation of parameters of a priori adopted probability laws, when a small sample has been drawn. More precisely: Let X$_{\textrm{1}}$,......X$_{\textrm{n}}$ be a system of n random variables, and assume the elementary probability f (x. θ) dx of X to be know, leaving only undetermined the value of a parameter θ. The problem is to estimate θ by means of n observed values x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....x$_{\textrm{n}}$ of X$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,X$_{\textrm{n}}$. The estimation taken as an approximate value of θ shall be one function t=H(x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,x$_{\textrm{n}}$) of the known values x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,x$_{\textrm{n}}$. Different methods have been proposed for the purpose of fixing which function H shall be chosen. First, writer deals with what is sometimes called the best unbiassed estimate of the parameter. H will be called an "unbiassed" estimate of θ, if the average value of H(x$_{\textrm{1}}$..x$_{\textrm{n}}$) is equal to θ. It is called the "best" unbiassed estimate, if the variance of H(x$_{\textrm{1}}$,. ... x$_{\textrm{n}}$) - i.e. the average of [H(x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,x$_{\textrm{n}}$)-Θ]$^{\textrm{2}}$ - is minimum. Writer makes clear that these definitions - though natural enough - are conventional and arbitrary ones. Most of the previous writers had applied this definition in the hypothesis of n being great and X satisfying the laplacian (so called normal) probability law. n arbitrary: Writer showed in a course of lectures in 1939, how to extend their formula to the general case by using Schwarz' inequality. He first proved that {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{H\}{\textbackslash}geq \{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, where σ $^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{v}}$ is written for the variance of v and A=1/f(x,Θ)∂/∂ Θf(x,Θ). Later on, he happened to hear that Doob had previously obtained the same result by the same method. n great: When, instead of supposing the average value of H to be θ, it is only assumed that this is so at the limit when n → ∞. writer shows that the lowest limit of {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{H\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{is\}{\textbackslash}geq \{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. Then, reverting to the first case, the question is to find, whether σ $_{\textrm{H}}$ may be equal to its lower bound {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$\{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. Writer points out that, generally, this does not happen. For example, when f(x, θ) = g(x - θ), the only case in which a function H may be found such that {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{H\}=\{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} is that one when X is a laplacian (so called normal) variable. Writer shows that a necessary and sufficient condition that one of the σ $_{\textrm{H}}$ be equal to {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$\{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} is that functions h(x),l(x),μ(θ) exist, such that f(x)=e$^{\textrm{μ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}′}}$(Θ)[h(x)-Θ]+μ (Θ)+l(x){\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. (We will then say that f(x) is a "distinguished function"). Then the minimizing function H is H$^{\textrm{′}}$(x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,x$_{\textrm{n}}$)=1/n[h(x$_{\textrm{1}}$)+....+h(x$_{\textrm{n}}$)]: so that the estimate of θ is t=1/nΣ $_{\textrm{i}}$h(x$_{\textrm{i}}$) In addition: (σ $_{\textrm{H$^{\textrm{′}}$}}$)$^{\textrm{2}}$=1/n μ $^{\textrm{′′}}$Θ. When f is known, but h is not, t is the unique root of Σ $_{\textrm{i}}$∂/∂ tL f(x$_{\textrm{ i}}$,t)=0. Writing T$_{\textrm{n}}$=H$^{\textrm{′}}$(x$_{\textrm{1}}$,....,x$_{\textrm{n}}$) and {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}xi \_\{n\}=\{{\textbackslash}textstyle{\textbackslash}frac\{T\_\{n\}-{\textbackslash}Theta\}\{{\textbackslash}sigma \_\{A\}\}\}{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\},{\textbackslash}xi \_\{n\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} tends to be a laplacian variable. Then writer raises the question: which change of parameter t = a (τ) - whence f(x, a(τ)) = φ(x, τ) - is such that φ(x, τ) is a distinguished function. And he finds that in this case, functions ϱ (θ), χ(θ), k(x), m(x) must exist, such that f(x,Θ)=e$^{\textrm{ϱ (Θ )k(x)+$_{\textrm{λ}}$(Θ)+m(x)}}$ (x, θ, being in such a case a "quasi" distinguished function. It happens that G. Darmois previously came to the same class of functions by solving a different problem, mentioned in the present memoir p. 195. In the second part, a comparison is made of the previous method with the method of the most probable value and with the method of maximum likelihood. The first one is based on the Bayes-Laplace formula. It is pointed out that the main objection to the use of this formula (that generally we do not know the a priori probability of θ) is balanced by the advantage of our knowing exactly the hypotheses on which the solution is based and our therefore also knowing the weakness of the solution, a weakness which is just as real, but not so apparent in the other methods. It is then shown that the best unbiassed estimate and the most probable value (when all values of θ are assumed to be equally probable) coïncide when f(x, θ) is a distinguished function (and even when it is a quasi-distinguished function, provided ϱ $^{\textrm{′}}$$_{\textrm{Θ}}$ does not change sign). As for the method of maximum likelihood, it is pointed out that it is founded on a plausible, but arbitrary principle which can only be justified by the successes it will achieve in those cases, where verification is possible.},

The generalisation has been made in two directions: 1. the results obtained for one parameter are extended to an arbitrary number of parameters by the introduction of the ellipsoid-indicatrix of a probability law. The ellipsoids relating to an estimate of the parameters are outside a fixed ellipsoid. 2. these results are not only valid, when the observations are independent, but also when their probability law is arbitrary. b) At the end of the paper some theorems are developed in regard to the intimate relations between these questions and the probability laws that permit af an "exhaustive summary" (i.e. a generalised notion of "sufficient statistic", defined by the writer). He points out that if an exhaustive summary exists, it is possible, without any loss of precision, to restrict oneself to functions of the observations that only make use of this summary. When there is no exhaustive summary there would always be loss of precision, if the number of variables were reduced. These last-mentioned results are valid in the case of independent observations only.},

The exponent of the optimal time complexity of matrix multiplication is usually denoted by \${\textbackslash}omega\$. This paper discusses new ideas for improving the laser method for fast matrix multiplication. We observe that the analysis of higher powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor [Coppersmith \& Winograd 1990] incurs a "combination loss", and we partially compensate for it using an asymmetric version of CW's hashing method. By analyzing the eighth power of the CW tensor, we give a new bound of \${\textbackslash}omega{\textless}2.371866\$, which improves the previous best bound of \${\textbackslash}omega{\textless}2.372860\$ [Alman \& Vassilevska Williams 2020].

We apply our findings to the quantum Hall effect, and evaluate the quantum Fisher information associated with the optimal measurement of the magnetic field for a system in the ground state of the effective Hamiltonian. The occupation of electron states with high momentum enforced by the Pauli principle leads to a super-Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity with a power law that depends on the geometry of the sensor.},

We fabricate micrometer-scale devices from graphene encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride and few-layer graphite. We optimize the magnetic field detection limit under different conditions. At 1 kHz for a 1 μm device, we estimate a detection limit of 700 nT Hz−1/2 at room temperature, 80 nT Hz−1/2 at 4.2 K, and 3 μT Hz−1/2 in 3 T background field at 4.2 K.

The exciting perspectives that ensue from these characteristics have triggered vivid experimental activities in the emerging field of ‘NV magnetometry’. It is the purpose of this article to review the recent progress in high-sensitivity nanoscale NV magnetometry, generate an overview of the most pertinent results of the last years and highlight perspectives for future developments. We will present the physical principles that allow for magnetic field detection with NV centres and discuss first applications of NV magnetometers that have been demonstrated in the context of nano magnetism, mesoscopic physics and the life sciences.},

	abstract = {Magnetometry and magnetic imaging with nitrogen–vacancy (NV) defects in diamond rely on the optical detection of electron spin resonance (ESR). However, this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak enough to avoid electron spin mixing. Here, we focus on the high off-axis magnetic field regime where spin mixing alters the NV defect spin dynamics. We first study, in a quantitative manner, the dependence of the NV defect optical properties on the magnetic field vector B. Magnetic-field-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are compared to a seven-level model of the NV defect that accounts for field-induced spin mixing. The model reproduces decreases in (i) ESR contrast, (ii) PL intensity and (iii) excited level lifetime with an increasing off-axis magnetic field. We next demonstrate that these effects can be used to perform all-optical imaging of the magnetic field component {\textbar}B⊥{\textbar} orthogonal on the NV defect axis. Using a scanning NV defect microscope, we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disc through both PL and fluorescence lifetime imaging. This all-optical method for high magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale might be of interest in the field of nanomagnetism, where samples producing fields in excess of several tens of milliteslas are typically found.},

For such "phase shift Hamiltonians" it has been shown that one cannot improve the channel quantum Fisher information by adding ancillas and letting the system interact with them. Here we investigate the general case, where the Hamiltonian is not necessarily a phase shift, and show that in this case in general it {\textbackslash}emph\{is\} possible to increase the quantum channel information and to reach an upper bound. This can be done by adding a term proportional to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, or by subtracting a term to the original Hamiltonian. Both methods do not make use of any ancillas and show therefore that for quantum channel estimation with arbitrary parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, entanglement with an ancillary system is not necessary to reach the best possible sensitivity. By adding an operator to the Hamiltonian we can also modify the time scaling of the channel quantum Fisher information. We illustrate our techniques with NV-center magnetometry and the estimation of the direction of a magnetic field in a given plane using a single spin-1 as probe.},

It is based on the assumption that out-of-equilibrium systems rapidly approach their equilibrium states, forgetting any information about their microscopic initial conditions. This fundamental paradigm is challenged by disordered systems, in which a slowdown or even absence of thermalization is expected. We report the observation of critical thermalization in a three dimensional ensemble of ∼106 electronic spins coupled via dipolar interactions. By controlling the spin states of nitrogen vacancy color centers in diamond, we observe slow, subexponential relaxation dynamics and identify a regime of power-law decay with disorder-dependent exponents; this behavior is modified at late times owing to many-body interactions. These observations are quantitatively explained by a resonance counting theory that incorporates the effects of both disorder and interactions.},

	abstract = {Solid-state spin systems such as nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond are promising for applications of quantum information, sensing and metrology. However, a key challenge for such solid-state systems is to realize a spin coherence time that is much longer than the time for quantum spin manipulation protocols. Here we demonstrate an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time (T2) of nitrogen-vacancy centres compared with previous measurements: T2≈0.6 s at 77 K. We employed dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress nitrogen-vacancy spin decoherence, and found that T2 is limited to approximately half of the longitudinal spin relaxation time over a wide range of temperatures, which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy spins, and thus could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body entanglement, and open a path to simulating driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {Quantum control and measurement are two sides of the same coin. To affect a dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe. By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state. This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time. Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive theory of nuclear spin polarization of 3He and 129Xe gases by spin-exchange collisions with optically pumped alkali-metal vapors. The most important physical processes considered are (1) spin-conserving spin-exchange collisions between like or unlike alkali-metal atoms; (2) spin-destroying collisions of the alkali-metal atoms with each other and with buffer-gas atoms; (3) electron-nuclear spin-exchange collisions between alkali-metal atoms and 3He or 129Xe atoms; (4) spin interactions in van der Waals molecules consisting of a Xe atom bound to an alkali-metal atom; (5) optical pumping by laser photons; (6) spatial diffusion. The static magnetic field is assumed to be small enough that the nuclear spin of the alkali-metal atom is well coupled to the electron spin and the total spin is very nearly a good quantum number. Conditions appropriate for the production of large quantities of spin-polarized 3He or 129Xe gas are assumed, namely, atmospheres of gas pressure and nearly complete quenching of the optically excited alkali-metal atoms by collisions with N2 or H2 gas. Some of the more important results of this work are as follows: (1) Most of the pumping and relaxation processes are sudden with respect to the nuclear polarization. Consequently, the steady-state population distribution of alkali-metal atoms is well described by a spin temperature, whether the rate of spin-exchange collisions between alkali-metal atoms is large or small compared to the optical pumping rate or the collisional spin-relaxation rates. (2) The population distributions that characterize the response to sudden changes in the intensity of the pumping light are not described by a spin temperature, except in the limit of very rapid spin exchange. (3) Expressions given for the radio-frequency (rf) resonance linewidths and areas can be used to make reliable estimates of the local spin polarization of the alkali-metal atoms. (4) Diffusion effects for these high-pressure conditions are mainly limited to thin layers at the cell surface and at internal resonant surfaces generated by radio-frequency magnetic fields when the static magnetic field has substantial spatial inhomogeneities. The highly localized effects of diffusion at these surfaces are described with closed-form analytic functions instead of the spatial eigenmode expansions that are appropriate for lower-pressure cells.},

We also observe an interesting narrowing effect due to diffusion. Signal-to-noise measurements yield a sensitivity of about 400 pG/√Hz. Based on photon shot noise, we project a sensitivity of 40 pG/√Hz. A theoretical optimization of the magnetometer indicates sensitivities on the order of 2 pG/√Hz should be achievable in a 1 cm3 volume. Because Cs has a higher saturated vapor pressure than other alkali metals, SERF magnetometers using Cs atoms are particularly attractive in applications requiring lower temperatures.},

	abstract = {Alkali-metal magnetometers use the coherent precession of polarized atomic spins to detect and measure magnetic fields. Recent advances have enabled magnetometers to become competitive with SQUIDs as the most sensitive magnetic field detectors, and they now find use in a variety of areas ranging from medicine and NMR to explosives detection and fundamental physics research. In this thesis we discuss several developments in alkali-metal atomic magnetometry for both practical and fundamental applications. We present a new method of polarizing the alkali atoms by modulating the optical pumping rate at both the linear and quadratic Zeeman resonance frequencies. We demonstrate experimentally that this method enhances the sensitivity of a potassium magnetometer operating in the Earth's field by a factor of 4, and we calculate that it can reduce the orientation-dependent heading error to less than 0.1 nT. We discuss a radio-frequency magnetometer for detection of oscillating magnetic fields with sensitivity better than 0.2 fT/ Hz , which we apply to the observation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from polarized water, as well as nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) signals from ammonium nitrate. We demonstrate that a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer can measure all three vector components of the magnetic field in an unshielded environment with comparable sensitivity to other devices. We find that octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) acts as an anti-relaxation coating for alkali atoms at temperatures below 170°C, allowing them to collide with a glass surface up to 2,000 times before depolarizing, and we present the first demonstration of high-temperature magnetometry with a coated cell. We also describe a reusable alkali vapor cell intended for the study of interactions between alkali atoms and surface coatings. Finally, we explore the use of a cesium-xenon SERF comagnetometer for a proposed measurement of the permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) of the electron and the 129Xe atom, with projected sensitivity of deltade=9x10 -30 e-cm and deltadXe=4x10 -31 e-cm after 100 days of integration; both bounds are more than two orders of magnitude better than the existing experimental limits on the EDMs of the electron and of any diamagnetic atom.},

The dominant experimental technology is the laser, and the theoretical paradigm is quantum optics.The Quantum World of Ultra-Cold Atoms and Light is a trilogy, which presents the quantum optics way of thinking and its applications to quantum devices. This book — The Physics of Quantum-Optical Devices — provides a comprehensive treatment of theoretical quantum optics. It covers applications to the optical manipulation of the quantum states of atoms, laser cooling, continuous measurement, quantum computers and quantum processors, superconducting systems and quantum networks. The subject is consistently formulated in terms of quantum stochastic techniques, and a systematic and thorough development of these techniques is a central part of the book. There is also a compact overview of the ideas of quantum information theory.The main aim of the book is to present the theoretical techniques necessary for the understanding of quantum optical devices, with special attention to those devices used in quantum information processing and quantum simulation. Although these techniques were developed originally for the optical regime, they are also applicable to electromagnetic radiation from the microwave realm to the ultra-violet, and for atomic systems, Josephson junction systems, quantum dots and nano-mechanical systems.},

	abstract = {Chaotic behaviour is ubiquitous and plays an important part in most fields of science. In classical physics, chaos is characterized by hypersensitivity of the time evolution of a system to initial conditions. Quantum mechanics does not permit a similar definition owing in part to the uncertainty principle, and in part to the Schrödinger equation, which preserves the overlap between quantum states. This fundamental disconnect poses a challenge to quantum–classical correspondence, and has motivated a long-standing search for quantum signatures of classical chaos. Here we present the experimental realization of a common paradigm for quantum chaos—the quantum kicked top— and the observation directly in quantum phase space of dynamics that have a chaotic classical counterpart. Our system is based on the combined electronic and nuclear spin of a single atom and is therefore deep in the quantum regime; nevertheless, we find good correspondence between the quantum dynamics and classical phase space structures. Because chaos is inherently a dynamical phenomenon, special significance attaches to dynamical signatures such as sensitivity to perturbation or the generation of entropy and entanglement, for which only indirect evidence has been available. We observe clear differences in the sensitivity to perturbation in chaotic versus regular, non-chaotic regimes, and present experimental evidence for dynamical entanglement as a signature of chaos.},

Known protocols usually rely on the preparation of entangled states and promise high or even optimal precision, but fall short in real-word applications because of the difficulty to generate entangled states and to protect them against decoherence. Here, we refrain from the preparation of entangled states but supplement the integrable parameter-encoding dynamics by non-linear kicks driving the system in the dynamical regime of quantum chaos. We show that large improvements in measurement precision are possible by modeling a spin-exchange relaxation-free alkali-vapor magnetometer where the non-linear kicks are realized by exploiting the ac Stark effect.},

Unlike the lighter alkali atoms, spin-polarized 87Rb atoms can undergo dipolar relaxation due to both the normal spin-spin dipole interaction and a second-order spin-orbit interaction with distant electronic states of the dimer. We present ab initio calculations for the second-order spin-orbit terms for both Rb2 and Cs2. The corrections lead to a reduction in the relaxation rate for 87Rb. Our primary concern is to analyze the sensitivity of the 87Rb trap loss to the uncertainties in the ground state molecular potentials. Since the scattering length for the a3Σ+u state is already known, the major uncertainties are associated with the X1Σ+g potential. After testing the effect of systematically modifying the short-range form of the molecular potentials over a reasonable range, and introducing our best estimate of the second-order spin-orbit interaction, we estimate that in the low temperature limit the rate coefficient for loss of Rb atoms from the f = 2,m = 2 state is between 0.4 × 10−15 cm3/s and 2.4 × 10−15 cm3/s (where this number counts two atoms lost per collision). In a pure condensate the rate coefficient would be reduced by 1/2.},

Here, we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that utilizes coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. We show the ability to detect temperature variations down to 1.8 mK (sensitivity of 9 mK/sqrt(Hz)) in an ultra-pure bulk diamond sample. Using NV centers in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment at length scales down to 200 nm. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the sub-cellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

In the present work, we use an ensemble of N∼1011 defect centers within an effective sensor volume of 8.5×10−4 mm3 for sensing at room temperature. By carefully eliminating noise sources and using high-quality diamonds with large NV concentrations, we demonstrate, for such sensors, a sensitivity scaling as 1/t√, where t is the total measurement time. The associated photon-shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity for ac signals of f=20 kHz is 0.9 pT/Hz−−−√. For a total measurement time of 100 s, we reach a standard deviation of about 100 fT.

	abstract = {Simple optical instruments are linear optical networks where the incident light modes are turned into equal numbers of outgoing modes by linear transformations. For example, such instruments are beam splitters, multiports, interferometers, fibre couplers, polarizers, gravitational lenses, parametric amplifiers, phase-conjugating mirrors and also black holes. The paper develops the quantum theory of simple optical instruments and applies the theory to a few characteristic situations, to the splitting and interference of photons and to the manifestation of Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen correlations in parametric downconversion. How to model irreversible devices such as absorbers and amplifiers is also shown. Finally, the paper develops the theory of Hawking radiation for a simple optical black hole. The paper is intended as a primer, as a nearly self-consistent tutorial. The reader should be familiar with basic quantum mechanics and statistics, and perhaps with optics and some elementary field theory. The quantum theory of light in dielectrics serves as the starting point and, in the concluding section, as a guide to understand quantum black holes.},

	abstract = {Fidelity serves as a benchmark for the reliability in quantum information processes, and has recently attracted much interest as a measure of the susceptibility of dynamics to perturbations. A rich variety of regimes for fidelity decay have emerged. The purpose of the present review is to describe these regimes, to give the theory that supports them, and to show some important applications and experiments. While we mention several approaches we use time correlation functions as a backbone for the discussion. Vanicek's uniform approach to semiclassics and random matrix theory provides important alternatives or complementary aspects. Other methods will be mentioned as we go along. Recent experiments in micro-wave cavities and in elastodynamic systems as well as suggestions for experiments in quantum optics shall be discussed.},
