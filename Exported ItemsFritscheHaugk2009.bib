	abstract = {The present contribution is based on the assumption that the probabilistic character of quantum mechanics does not originate from uncertainties caused by the process of measurement or observation, but rather reflects the presence of objectively existing vacuum fluctuations whose action on massive particles is calibrated by Planck's constant and effects an additional irregular motion. We describe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles for each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a Navier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By averaging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which can be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept allows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to interacting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental setup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and the residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the particle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two sub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or left-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes physically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field. We demonstrate that this orientation-decomposed ''Zitterbewegung'' behaves - in accordance with Schroedinger's original idea - as a spin-type angular momentum which appears in addition to a possible orbital angular moment of the particle. We derive the non-relativistic time-dependent Pauli equation and propose a theory of the Stern-Gerlach experiment. The Dirac equation can be derived similarly.},
