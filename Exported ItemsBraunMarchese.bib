	abstract = {Mechanical quantum systems, such as resonators and levitated particles, offer unique opportunities for quantum metrology. Particularly, their significant mass and quantum-level control enable applications in measuring gravitational effects. This article highlights key challenges, alongside potential solutions to advance precision sensing and quantum-gravitational research.},
