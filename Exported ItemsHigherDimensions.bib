	abstract = {In this review we present a thoroughly comprehensive survey of recent work on modified theories of gravity and their cosmological consequences. Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, scalar–tensor, Einstein–æther, and Bimetric theories, as well as TeVeS, f(R), general higher-order theories, Hořava–Lifschitz gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions including Kaluza–Klein, Randall–Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole.},

The discussion of vacuum gravity is pedagogical, with detailed reviews of Myers-Perry solutions, black rings, and solution-generating techniques. We discuss black-hole solutions of maximal supergravity theories, including black holes in anti-de Sitter space. General results and open problems are discussed throughout.},

	abstract = {We review a growing theoretical motivation and evidence that the number of dimensions actually reduces at high energies. This reduction can happen near the Planck scale, or much before, the dimensions that are reduced can be effective, spectral, topological or the usual dimensions, but many things points toward the fact that the high energy theories appear to propagate in a lower dimensional space, rather than a higher dimensional one. We will concentrate on a particular scenario of "vanishing" or "evolving dimensions" where the dimensions open up as we increase the length scale that we are probing, but will also mention related models that point to the same direction, i.e. the causal dynamical triangulation, asymptotic safety, as well as evidence coming from a non-commutative quantum theories, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and phenomenon of "asymptotic silence". It is intriguing that experimental evidence for the high energy dimensional reduction may already exists - a statistically significant planar alignment of events with energies higher than TeV has been observed in high altitude cosmic ray experiments. A convincing evidence for dimensional reduction may be found in future in collider experiments and gravity waves observatories.},
