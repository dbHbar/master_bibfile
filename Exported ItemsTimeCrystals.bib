	abstract = {Time crystals are classified as discrete or continuous depending on whether they spontaneously break discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. Although discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems, the experimental realization of a continuous time crystal is still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal.

              Time crystals are a new dynamical phase of quantum matter resulting from the breaking of time-translation symmetry and the subsequent interplay between interactions forming self-organized phases. To date, discrete time crystals have been observed in periodically driven systems. By contrast, Kongkhambut
              et al
              . report the observation of spontaneous breaking of a continuous time translation symmetry in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate inside a high-finesse optical cavity (see the Perspective by LeBlanc). Using a time-independent pump, the authors observed a limit cycle phase that is characterized by emergent periodic oscillations of the intracavity photon number and is accompanied by the atomic density cycling through recurring patterns: a continuous time crystal. —ISO
