	abstract = {We study the sensitivity of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer that contains in addition to the phase shifter a non-linear element. By including both elements in a cavity or a loop that the light transverses many times, a non-linear kicked version of the interferometer arises. We study its sensitivity as function of the phase shift, the kicking strength, the maximally reached average number of photons, and damping due to photon loss for an initial coherent state. We find that for vanishing damping Heisenberg-limited scaling of the sensitivity arises if squeezing dominates the total photon number. For small to moderate damping rates the non-linear kicks can considerably increase the sensitivity as measured by the quantum Fisher information per unit time.},
