	abstract = {We consider a model of quantum computation in which the set of elementary operations is limited to Clifford unitaries, the creation of the state ∣0⟩, and qubit measurement in the computational basis. In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state ρ, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which ρ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of ρ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain “magic” directions. If the polarization of ρ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65\%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03554},
	abstract = {Generic quantum-circuit simulation appears intractable for conventional computers and may be unnecessary because useful quantum circuits exhibit significant structure that can be exploited during simulation. For example, Gottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called stabilizer circuits, which can be simulated efficiently using group-theory techniques and insights from quantum physics. Realistic circuits enriched with quantum error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant procedures are dominated by stabilizer subcircuits and contain a relatively small number of non-Clifford components. Therefore, we develop new data structures and algorithms that facilitate parallel simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more compact storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated bookkeeping. Our implementation, called Quipu, simulates certain quantum arithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial time and space for equal superpositions of \$n\$-qubits. On such instances, known linear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the (state-of-the-art) BDD-based simulator QuIDDPro, take exponential time. We simulate quantum Fourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant circuits using Quipu, and the results demonstrate that our stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms QuIDDPro in all cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware simulations of quantum circuits were difficult to parallelize, we demonstrate that Quipu can be parallelized with a nontrivial computational speedup.},

By only decomposing the non-Clifford gates, we take advantage of the Gottesman-Knill theorem and build a bridge between stabilizer-based simulation and Feynman-path-type simulation. We give two variants of this method: stabilizer-based path-integral recursion (SPIR) and stabilizer projector contraction (SPC). We also analyze further advantages and disadvantages of our method compared to the Bravyi-Gosset algorithm and recursive Feynman path-integral algorithms. We construct a parametrized circuit ensemble and identify the parameter regime in this ensemble where our method offers superior performance. We also estimate the time cost for simulating quantum supremacy experiments with our method and motivate potential improvements of the method.},

Typical quantum devices utilize a gateset with a single two-qubit Clifford entangling gate per pair of coupled qubits, however, in some applications access to a non-Clifford two-qubit gate can result in more optimal circuit decompositions and also allows more flexibility in optimizing over noise. We demonstrate calibration of a low error non-Clifford Controlled-\${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\{2\}\$ phase (CS) gate on a cloud based IBM Quantum computing using the Qiskit Pulse framework. To measure the gate error of the calibrated CS gate we perform non-Clifford CNOT-Dihedral interleaved randomized benchmarking. We are able to obtain a gate error of \$5.9(7) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ at a gate length 263 ns, which is close to the coherence limit of the associated qubits, and lower error than the backends standard calibrated CNOT gate.},

	abstract = {The standard stabilizer formalism provides a setting to show that quantum computation restricted to operations within the Clifford group are classically efficiently simulable: this is the content of the well-known Gottesman-Knill theorem. This work analyzes the mathematical structure behind this theorem to find possible generalizations and derivation of constraints required for constructing a non-trivial generalized Clifford group. We prove that if the closure of the stabilizing set is dense in the set of \$SU(d)\$ transformations, then the associated Clifford group is trivial, consisting only of local gates and permutations of subsystems. This result demonstrates the close relationship between the density of the stabilizing set and the simplicity of the corresponding Clifford group. We apply the analysis to investigate stabilization with binary observables for qubits and find that the formalism is equivalent to the standard stabilization for a low number of qubits. Based on the observed patterns, we conjecture that a large class of generalized stabilizer states are equivalent to the standard ones. Our results can be used to construct novel Gottesman-Knill-type results and consequently draw a sharper line between quantum and classical computation.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for classical simulation of quantum circuits over the Clifford+𝑇 gate set. The runtime of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of qubits and the number of Clifford gates in the circuit but exponential in the number of 𝑇 gates. The exponential scaling is sufficiently mild that the algorithm can be used in practice to simulate medium-sized quantum circuits dominated by Clifford gates. The first demonstrations of fault-tolerant quantum circuits based on 2D topological codes are likely to be dominated by Clifford gates due to a high implementation cost associated with logical 𝑇 gates. Thus our algorithm may serve as a verification tool for near-term quantum computers which cannot in practice be simulated by other means. To demonstrate the power of the new method, we performed a classical simulation of a hidden shift quantum algorithm with 40 qubits, a few hundred Clifford gates, and nearly 50 𝑇 gates.},
