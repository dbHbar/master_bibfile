	abstract = {Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \$\${\textbackslash}varLambda {\textbackslash}mathrm\{=2.14\}{\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$\$when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143\% ± 0.003\% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of \$\$2.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.3\$\$. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or \$\$3\$\$\$\${\textbackslash}times \$\$\$\$\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$\$cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},
