	abstract = {We show that \$n\$-bit integers can be factorized by independently running a quantum circuit with \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$ gates for \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}+4\$ times, and then using polynomial-time classical post-processing. The correctness of the algorithm relies on a number-theoretic heuristic assumption reminiscent of those used in subexponential classical factorization algorithms. It is currently not clear if the algorithm can lead to improved physical implementations in practice.},
