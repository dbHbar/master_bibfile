	abstract = {During the past five yeas, researchers have achieved advances in both sample elaboration and measurement techniques in an effort to witness macroscopic quantum tunneling of magnetization. Important advances include experimental results of relaxation measurements, single particle measurements, and domain wall junction, quantum coherence and quantum resonance measurements. Quantum resonance measurements have shown unambiguously quantum tunneling of magnetization at a scale of one nanometer.},
