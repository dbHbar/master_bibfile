            Preparing and observing quantum states of nanoscale particles is a challenging task with great relevance for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. In contrast to atomic systems with discrete transitions, nanoparticles exhibit a practically continuous absorption spectrum and thus their quantum dynamics cannot be easily manipulated. Here, we demonstrate that charged nanoscale dielectrics can be artificially endowed with a discrete level structure by coherently interfacing their rotational and translational motion with a superconducting qubit. We propose a pulsed scheme for the generation and read-out of motional quantum superpositions and entanglement between several levitated nanoparticles, providing an all-electric platform for networked hybrid quantum devices.},

            A review outlines the challenges and prospects of controlling levitated nano- and micro-objects in a vacuum.
          , 
            
              BACKGROUND
              Levitation of large objects has become a widely used technique in science and engineering, and the control of levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum has gained considerable momentum. The ability to manipulate and measure translation, rotation, and free dynamics of these objects with high precision has led to a new experimental platform with opportunities for fundamental and applied research. For example, the high acceleration and force sensitivities of levitated objects are fueling both sensor development and searches for new physics, and the underdamped dynamics in complex potential landscapes enables the testing of stochastic thermodynamic models. Moreover, damping and noise can be reduced to a fundamental minimum in ultrahigh vacuum, paving the way for quantum-limited sensing and detection, as well as for exploration of macroscopic quantum physics in a hitherto unexplored regime of large masses.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Levitation of micrometer-sized objects in vacuum was first demonstrated in the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin in the 1970s. In the following decades, his work inspired the development of trapping and cooling of atoms and contributed to the rise of modern atomic physics. Levitation of microscopic solids focused on applications in air and liquids, with substantial breakthroughs, particularly in biophysics. In 2010, quantum optical control techniques were first proposed for levitation in vacuum, with the possibility of cooling the motion of a levitated nanoparticle in an optical cavity to the quantum regime. These proposals have been complemented by experimental research of control mechanisms based on optical, electrical, and magnetic forces. By now, both optical cavity–based and active-feedback cooling schemes have successfully cooled the motion of a dielectric levitated nanoparticle into the quantum ground state. Aside from translation, rotational degrees of freedom can also be controlled. Nanoparticle rotation frequencies in the gigahertz range are limited only by the tensile strength of the material. Furthermore, both translation and rotation of levitated particles have been coupled to single solid-state spins, providing a means of engineering the quantum motional and rotational states of a levitated object.
              Levitation allows particles to evolve in complex potential landscapes that can be actively shaped or switched off to include free dynamics. Furthermore, the coupling of the particle to its environment, and thus its dissipation and noise, can be tuned via gas pressure over several orders of magnitude. This flexibility has become the basis for studying nonequilibrium physics with levitated particles in both the classical and quantum regimes.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Levitation of nano- and micro-objects in high vacuum offers new opportunities for research and applications by providing previously unattainable isolation from the environment. The current toolbox includes magnets, metals, diamonds containing color centers, graphene, liquid droplets, and even superfluid helium—all of which can be levitated and controlled by means of optical, electrical, and magnetic interactions. These interactions provide a means to couple the internal degrees of freedom (e.g., phonons, magnons, excitons) to the well-controlled external degrees of freedom (translation, rotation). Levitated systems are clean test beds for materials science, where matter in extreme conditions (e.g. high internal stress or out-of-equilibrium behavior) can be probed and even engineered. Furthermore, levitated systems are an ideal platform for the study of nonequilibrium physics, such as the thermalization of mesoscopic objects in vacuum as well as complex many-particle physics (e.g. interparticle interactions induced by short-range electromagnetic fields or by tunneling of internal excitations between particles). Extending control to all degrees of freedom of a levitated particle is key to reduce sources of noise and decoherence. This step opens the door to a new regime of macroscopic quantum physics (e.g., the preparation of macroscopic quantum superpositions of objects composed of billions of atoms) and the probing of weak forces in unexplored regimes, including non-Newtonian gravity and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Finally, the use of levitated systems for ultrasensitive detection of forces brings opportunities for commercial sensing applications, including gravimeters, pressure sensors, inertial force (acceleration, rotation) sensors, and electric and magnetic field sensors. Exploration of levitated sensors has already begun, but their performance has yet to be benchmarked against those of existing sensing technologies.
              
                
                  Controlled levitation of macroscopic- and atomic-scale objects has advanced technology and fundamental science, respectively.
                  Levitodynamics—the levitation and control of microscopic solids in vacuum—targets objects in the intermediate-size regime. This research area provides access to unexplored research directions in quantum science, materials science, nonequilibrium physics, and sensing.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            The control of levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum—which capitalizes on scientific achievements in the fields of atomic physics, control theory, and optomechanics—is of considerable interest. The ability to couple the motion of levitated systems to internal degrees of freedom, as well as to external forces and systems, provides opportunities for science and technology. Attractive research directions, ranging from fundamental quantum physics to commercial sensors, have been unlocked by the many recent experimental achievements, including motional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Here we review the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area devoted to understanding, controlling, and using levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum.},

From a simple model of elastic scattering, we show that the nondiagonal density-matrix elements of the system exponentially decay. The decay rate depends on the difference of scattering amplitudes for different rotational configurations, leading to the gradual loss of quantum coherence between the pointer states in the orientational space. For a dielectric ellipsoid immersed in a photon-gas environment (assuming no absorption), the decay rate is found to be proportional to the seventh power of the temperature. For an ellipsoidal object interacting with massive particles, the decay rate is proportional to the 5/2 power of the temperature. Both are different from the case of translational decoherence induced by the same environment scattering. For photon scattering, the coherence time in the rotational degrees of freedom is shown to be much shorter than that in the translational degrees of freedom.},
