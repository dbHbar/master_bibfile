	abstract = {This work gives a detailed investigation of matrix product state (MPS) representations for pure multipartite quantum states. We determine the freedom in representations with and without translation symmetry, derive respective canonical forms and provide efficient methods for obtaining them. Results on frustration free Hamiltonians and the generation of MPS are extended, and the use of the MPS-representation for classical simulations of quantum systems is discussed.},
