	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to derive explicit formulae for the
computation of the Riemannian Bures metric g on the manifold of
(finite-dimensional) nonsingular density matrices . This Riemannian
metric introduced by Uhlmann generalizes the Fubini-Study metric to
mixed states and is the infinitesimal version of the Bures distance.
Several formulae are known for computing the Bures metric in low
dimensions. The formulae presented in this paper allow for computing
in finite dimensions without any diagonalization procedures. The first
equations we give are, essentially, of the form , where is a matrix of
invariants of . A further formula, , is adapted to the local
orthogonal decomposition at generic points.},
