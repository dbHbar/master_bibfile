	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The celebrated Bell inequality, a theorem published by John Bell in 1964, has long served as a basis for experimentally testing whether nature satisfies local realism. All experiments conducted to date have implied rejection of local-realist hypotheses. But because of experimental limitations all those tests suffered from loopholes  either the locality or the detection loophole. Here, Ronald Hanson and colleagues perform a Bell test that closes these loopholes. Their results are consistent with a violation of the inequality, although the authors reject local-realist hypotheses by two standard deviations only. The experimental setup allows for improvements in the statistics that may consolidate the result. In addition to its fundamental importance, a loophole-free Bell test is an important building block in quantum information processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
