	abstract = {Motivated by a variety of theories that predict new effects, we tested the gravitational 1/r2 law at separations between 10.77 mm and 137μm using two different 10-fold azimuthally symmetric torsion pendulums and rotating 10-fold symmetric attractors. Our work improves upon other experiments by up to a factor of about 100. We found no deviation from Newtonian physics at the 95\% confidence level and interpret these results as constraints on extensions of the standard model that predict Yukawa or power-law forces. We set a constraint on the largest single extra dimension (assuming toroidal compactification and that one extra dimension is significantly larger than all the others) of R*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}160μm, and on two equal-sized large extra dimensions of R*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}130μm. Yukawa interactions with {\textbar}α{\textbar}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 are ruled out at 95\% confidence for λ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}197μm. Extra-dimensions scenarios stabilized by radions are restricted to unification masses M*{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}3.0TeV/c2, regardless of the number of large extra dimensions. We also provide new constraints on power-law potentials V(r)∝r−k with k between 2 and 5 and on the γ5 couplings of pseudoscalars with m{\textless}{\textasciitilde}10meV/c2.},
