	abstract = {We propose a novel approach to qubit thermometry using a quantum switch, that introduces an indefinite causal order in the probe-bath interaction, to significantly enhance the thermometric precision. The resulting qubit probe shows improved precision in both low and high temperature regimes when compared to optimal qubit probes studied previously. It even performs better than a Harmonic oscillator probe, in spite of having only two energy levels rather than an infinite number of energy levels as that in a harmonic oscillator. We thereby show unambiguously that quantum resources such as the quantum switch can significantly improve equilibrium thermometry. We also derive a new form of thermodynamic uncertainty relation that is tighter and depends on the energy gap of the probe. The present work may pave the way for using indefinite causal order as a metrological resource.},

	abstract = {Relativistic causality principles constrain information processing possibilities in space-time. No superluminal causation (NSC) and no superluminal signaling (NSS) are two such principles which, although related, are distinct. In this work we study the consequence of these principles by considering the tasks of generating non-classical correlations within two space-time configurations. Considering theories constrained by NSC, we show that the first task is impossible in any classical theory and the second is impossible in any (possibly non-classical) theory. However, we construct a protocol enabling non-classical correlations to be generated in both configurations in a theory restricted by the weaker NSS principle. To do so we exploit theories that allow an effect called jamming. In our realisation, non-communicating agents sharing classical resources and assisted by jamming, can generate PR-box correlations. Using this protocol the violation of NSC without violating NSS would be verifiable. We discuss the implications of these findings for the speed of generation of non-classical correlations. Our work offers insights into the differences in information processing power of theories constrained by NSC, NSS and other relativistic causality principles.},
