	abstract = {Despite growing interest, there is a scarcity of known predictions in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects become observable. Here, we investigate a combined atom-field system in a curved spacetime, focusing specifically on gravitational-wave backgrounds. We show that a plane gravitational wave modifies spontaneous emission from a single atom, both in terms of sidebands in the spectrum and directionality of the emission. While the total decay rate remains unchanged, implying that no information about the gravitational wave is stored in the atomic internal state alone, the wave leaves imprints on the evolution of the composite atom-field system. To quantify how well this effect can be measured, we analyze both the classical Fisher information associated with photon number measurements and the quantum Fisher information. Our analysis indicates that the effect could be measured in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and points to spontaneous emission as a potential probe of low-frequency gravitational waves.},
