	abstract = {Einstein called entanglement, a type of correlation found only in quantum physics, 'spooky action at a distance'. Experimental tests known as Bell inequalities have all but ruled out a classical explanation for such correlations, but the possibility remains that a first event could influence a second one, if the influence occurs faster than the speed of light. An impressive new experiment has been performed with a view to establishing a lower limit for the speed of such hypothetical influences. The experiment involved a Bell inequality test lasting more than 24 hours between two Swiss villages 18 km apart and approximately east–west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. Taking advantage of the Earth's rotation, the experiment allowed the determination of a lower bound for the speed of any such influence. The conclusion was that the minimal speed of hypothetical spooky action at a distance, under plausible assumptions for this experiment, is at least 10,000 times greater than the speed of light. The existence in nature of a real spooky action at a distance is therefore deemed implausible.},

	abstract = {We consider the possibility of describing, within the special theory of relativity, particles with spacelike four-momentum, which therefore have velocities greater than that of light in vacuum. The usual objections to such particles are discussed, and they are found to be unconvincing within the framework of relativistic quantum theory. A quantum field theory of noninteracting, spinless, faster-than-light particles is described. The field theory is Lorentz-invariant, but must be quantized with Fermi statistics. The associated particle theory has the property that the particle number is not Lorentz-invariant, and the no-particle state is not Lorentz-invariant either. Nevertheless, the principle of relativity is satisfied. The Lorentz invariance implies a relation between emission and absorption processes, in contradiction to the usual case. Some comments are made about the problem of introducing interactions into the field theory. The limiting velocity is 𝑐, but a limit has two sides.},
